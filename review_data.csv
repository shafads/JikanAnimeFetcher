55791,539539.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Season Two continues Oshi no Ko’s two-pronged approach to storytelling, providing a behind-the-scenes look at the Japanese entertainment industry while simultaneously serving up a long-form murder mystery. This season shifts its spotlight onto a fictional theater production, opening in media res with an unusually long static shot of the stage. It’s a fun scene as part of an anime adaptation of a real-world manga, which has an arc about adapting a fictional, in-universe manga into an in-universe stage play that you then get to experience as if you were part of the in-universe audience. As fun as these meta-layers are, though, Oshi no Ko is moreconcerned with exploring the conflicting perspectives of its characters. Many of them are involved with the aforementioned stage play, and their attitudes and creative methods constantly clash throughout the thirteen episodes of this season. Oshi no Ko also features some brilliant animation work that elevates its already-solid source material to new heights. Episode 6 in particular ends with a spectacular, wordless sequence on how a side character’s life changed as a result of his involvement with the play.

For me, the main highlights of this season are the in-depth, humanized exploration of the manga-to-stage-play adaptation process that covered a lot of unexpected perspectives, the compelling narrative arcs of several recurring characters (but not all of them, unfortunately), the much smoother transitions between low-stakes and high-stakes scenes (compared to the first season), and the striking visuals. I was not a huge fan of Ruby’s general absence or the (expected) soapy melodrama.

As a whole, this season was rewarding to dig into. It’s a treat for your eyes and a rollercoaster for your emotions. After seeing what it accomplished, I would highly recommend giving Oshi no Ko a try, as it was one of my favorite shows this year."
55791,539542.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Oshi no Ko season 2 might have started a little slow, but once it got going, we got episodes that were on par with if not better than anything in season 1. The Tokyo Blade Arc in the manga wasn’t my fave, but the love and attention to detail including anime original scenes that Doga Kobo added in the anime took it to a whole other level and over season 1’s story arc. It’s in this second season, which really feels more like a second cour of one continuous season, that we truly see the story of Oshi no Ko take shape. While the toxicityof the entertainment industry is certainly part of Oshi no Ko, it’s ultimately a revenge story and this season sees things begin to fall into place on that front. It’s a different experience from season 1 since it focuses on the play, characters’ internal struggles and it starts slow, but I promise you if you stick around this season you will be very satisfied with where things go. 

So I said it before, but it’s really important to emphasise that this season of Oshi no Ko is a different sort of story from the first. I don’t want people to come into this blind and then the first couple episodes are a little annoying with the director drama and you give up watching it. Yes, she’s annoying, and yes, it gets better. It’s a lot slower at the start than last season was. No 1 hour film-like premiere, no suicide attempts etc. Instead, a lot of the conflict in this season is internal. Akane dealing with her insecurities and achieving her acting goals, Kana dealing with her feelings for Aqua and reconciling with her past, etc., the play is used as a conduit through which a lot of this happens. The characters that the cast portray in the play have many similarities and so they’re able to express themselves through those characters in ways they normally wouldn’t be able to. ESPECIALLY Aqua and Akane who get a ton of development in this season. Aqua can kind of come off as edgy and one dimensional at times, but this season shows there’s a lot more to him. For me, the slow build up to the play was entirely worth it just for the 3-4 episodes that we got of it. Doga Kobo really absorbed me into the story as if I were on the stage during the play. 

Let’s face it, ship wars are a big reason for Oshi no Ko’s popularity and anime onlies could be forgiven for being a little confused on why the debate is so strong. Season 1 had Kana firmly in the lead, but this season is where the real best girl, Akane gets some of her big moments and really introduces herself as the best character in this series. This was a massive part of my enjoyment for the season because I am unapologetically a huge Akane stan and my girl delivered this season. So many memorable moments, face serves, you name it she was great. It also helps that Akane is so supportive of Aqua and is the driving force behind a lot of important plot moments. If you weren’t sure why the debates were so heated and passionate before, well you’ll know after this. Even with the staff’s obvious Kana bias, Akane was able to really shine through both in her role as Sayahime in the play and her everyday life. 

Production wise Doga Kobo did an even better job in this cour than season 1 in my opinion. The Tokyo Blade play looked incredible with some episodes surpassing season 1’s B Komachi concert debut. “Magical” is the best way I could describe it. But there’s also more subtle improvements that I enjoyed a lot too such as the way episodes bleed into the ED so well. I’m a huge fan of shows ending with a scene that merges into the ED because it preserves a sort of “continuity”. Speaking of which, Burning is an incredible track, as is the OP, Fatal. They might not have the radio power of Mephisto and Idol from last season, but they’re still two very good tracks. Touched on this earlier as well, but it bears repeating. The anime original scenes that DG added really took some parts of the season to another level. They really understand the story and characters so well and know exactly when to interject a new scene to connect things. 

Oshi no Ko season 2 is really where things start getting going and where a lot of the hype that you’ve indubitably seen online for this series comes from. It’s a different sort of story from season 1 and takes a minute to get going, but when it does the character development and emotional moments are top tier. If you like Oshi no Ko it’s a no brainer to keep up with s2 and for those potential newcomers, I really encourage you to go in with an open mind and don’t let the ship stuff on social media act as a deterrent. There’s some great stuff in this series and there’s a reason it’s so big.

Oshi no Ko season 2 gets 10 stars, out of 10."
55791,539658.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Absolute Cinema In Oshi no Ko Season 2, the story deepens and retains its unique charm while continuing to explore themes of reincarnation, revenge, and the complexities of the entertainment industry. Although the core plot still revolves around the twins, Aqua and Ruby, their personal journeys evolve, delving into more mature and darker territory. The season introduces more mystery, especially around the death of their mother, Ai, and hints at further supernatural elements that enhance the drama. Realism of Reactions: The emotional responses of the characters are grounded in their past experiences. Aqua’s burdened demeanor and Ruby’s eventual emotional breakdown feel natural given the weight of theirpast traumas and the overwhelming situations they face in their current lives. This psychological depth helps ground the more fantastical elements of the show"
55791,539994.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Oshi no ko is fantastic. It will most definitely become an anime classic, and as I've said hundreds of times, it does a fantastic job telling stories and events about the Japanese entertainment industry, good or bad. This season extends on that as it focused on how mangakas feel when their project gets an adaptation, which yes while it is an honor, can be a huge headache. The direction and theme of that entire arc was excellent and the anime did a great job telling that story. However, I love aka akasaka and this was my same issue with the manga, the revenge plot doesfeel forced. The first entire arc had me me on the edge of my seat, but once the playwright arc ended it falls a little flat. Unfortunately at this point and time it feels like they are forcing the revenge aspect of the show onto us and it doesn't feel very consistent. Great anime overall and i really believe we have a classic on our hands here. I just thought season 1 was slightly better. I give this a solid 8/10."
55791,540213.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"The Good: - Art direction is spectacular with many experiments that elevate the show to another level - Cinematic frame compositions are on top of the medium - Beautiful Character development of main and supporting roles exposing full range of emotions within the characters - Opening and Ending (especially ending) OST just fits exceptionally well (love that guitar in the endlast episode.  

The Ugly:
- nil

Conclusion:
2nd Season of Oshi No Ko is a great follow up after first one. Anime is meticulously crafted. From presentation, art direction to character development it demonstrates high creative potential and passion of the studio. Story develops with each next episode and beautifully closes the arc of Tokyo Blade show. That said, ending felt somewhat puzzling and disjointed from the whole story, but sets good grounds for the 3rd Season."
55791,539562.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Nothing I can write here will even begin to do justice just how amazing this season was, if you found literally any enjoyment at all out of season 1 then you need to watch this immediately, it was just absolutely incredible in every single aspect, the art, the soundtrack, the writing, the dialogue, everything. Season 1 was already a masterpiece for me and this season somehow managed to improve on it in every way. There’s really no other show that has the same vibes as Oshi no Ko, the way the characters talk and interact with each other feels so realistic and is always sogripping that you almost forget about how absurd the original concept of the story is and how we even got here. This season doubles down on both that realism and that absurdity, and never have the two meshed so well, I was absolutely hooked from the first second to the very last, and I can’t wait to see where it goes from here. Do yourself a favour if you haven’t already and watch it right now.

It’s just so peak."
55791,539617.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"It speaks volumes about Oshi no Ko that the story arc that has by far the best character work, most engaging storytelling and least active problems with its writing also has the absolute least to do with its fundamentals. The Tokyo Blade storyline is the best its in-depth exploration of industry mechanics gets, Kana and Akane's dynamic gets explored with so much more depth, and even Aqua has some more interesting internal conflicts to deal with. Melt's highlight episode is even one of my strongest contenders for episode of the year. And once this arc ends it immediately goes back to being as shallow, pretentiousand condescending as it was in season 1 like it never stopped. My highest praises I can sing for season 2 is that the first two thirds where it stops being Oshi no Ko are also by far the best that it has to offer."
55791,539564.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Oshi no Ko season 2 massively builds upon the foundation set in its first season. The already amazing animation comes back stronger than ever, character arcs feel more integrated and deeper. The slightly odd aspects to the show have massively reduced screen time and previously sidelined concepts find themselves thoroughly explored. I debated a lot on rating but my feeling heading out of it is a 9/10, the greatest season to season improvement I’ve seen yet. To start with the animation here is gorgeous, the previous season had made good use of light shadow and color but still had some generic looking scenes. In thesecond season every single shot is jam packed with color and emotion. If they cannot come up with something for a shot the frequent cut aways to amazing unique animation to explain concepts serve to fill the void. Multiple color palettes are used depending on the context but all of them are amazing. The animations of the now required dynamic fights in the theater sections were also extremely well done and would’ve easily been the best in a normal season if not for strong competition from Elusive Samurai. 

Continuing with visuals the character designs continue to be very strong with the returning star motif and the stage outfits being great stand outs. In my opinion the star motif in particular felt even more strongly used this season and it was a great way to convey someone’s state changing without needing to spell it out for viewers. The outfit choices for everyday wear were also great and I really enjoyed looking at them for my own style inspiration. It’s very refreshing to see women dressed normally (or normal for their social status in a few cases) instead of what we often see in anime. Akane’s outfits in particular are very similar to the types of things I like to wear. 

I’m not a musician so I usually refrain from commentary on soundtracks as I don’t understand the dynamics at play but I wanted to call out the strong showing here. The piano themes they use for backing in tense scenes are really good and the insert songs, OPs and EDs remain great as well. 

My strongest criticism of Oshi No Ko in the past has been it’s treatment of women. Especially in the first season the way women hoard around aqua and fawn over him was extremely annoying and while it might be something funny or interesting for me really takes things away from me. This aspect is still present in the second season but finds itself massively diminished in favor of an arc that focuses on two women's dreams to the exclusion of their affections. This is a massively beneficial change that saves the show from what could’ve been a disaster. This is not to say they completely ignore this dynamic but I’m very happy with the direction they are going and found myself far less annoyed. 

Similarly I found the treatment of the Idol aspects in the first season to be a bit pedestrian and uninteresting, serving to somewhat glorify the industry in something I think should showcase why it’s terrible for young women. The second season while having a bit of this massively cleans up it’s act in this regard. The focus away from these aspects into other portions of the show I find more interesting certainly went a long way in improving my opinion of this season. 

Continuing on this I’m very happy with the way the show has been treating women as human beings with their own dreams. Even women with romantic attraction have other things going on in their life that they consider important. They aren’t one dimensional and can coexist on multiple fronts like real people, especially highlighted by a sound off your dreams moment in the last episode. I touched upon this earlier but this decision massively improves the stage play arc by making it about their career goals instead of something to do with possession of Aqua. The largest exception to this behavior is probably R
uby and to a lesser degree Kana. In Ruby’s case I do find her brocon cutaways to be grating, unfunny, and uninteresting however it does also seem like the show portrays this as a character failing. With Kana I find the situation to be less distasteful, sometimes funny, and still a little bit annoying and once again it does seem like future development is in store for this. 

The characterization of the cast outside of romance is just generally extremely good. You get a great idea of *why* people do things and it refuses to play into the idea that people do things for no reason. People have convictions behind their actions which can be explored and deconstructed if you take the time to understand them. The depictions of despair are also really great and I was happy to see one of my favorite motifs portrayed so well. There’s a few blunders present, most notably an extremely simple scene involving a musician but these are stand outs in part because of their length and are easy to let fly you by. 

The last episode served as a capstone integrating  best in the series with its otherworldly visuals, well placed insert, and deepening mystery. They’ve managed to transform me from someone who was debating watching season 2 at all to someone who is quite excited to see where DogaKobo goes next."
55791,539521.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"We keep digging deeper into the entertainment industry with all its drama, issues and its dark secrets behind the scenes. While we try to figure out the truth behind Aqua’ and Ruby’s past and future. In this season we first follow the Tokyo Blade arc, where Aqua stars in a theatrical show together with Akane and Kana. Where we later in the season then start to focus more on Ruby as the idol world is calling once again. For the plot of the season it is mostly structured around one major arc and then introduces a new arc. Through the major arc is the plot focused aroundthe Tokyo Blade play, and is very much focused around acting. But the plot is not just focused on their acting skill, but their reason for how they act, what drives their style of acting. This gives an in-depth feeling to the plot where it is not just a play, but a media that shows who they are as people and how they show themselves. We also get an in depth perspective to how the adaptation of a story from one media to another can be a struggle and involves many elements.
For the later arc it is somewhat a build up, it is leading up to the future and what is to come. But this is not done with small plotlines being hinted at and is instead done with bold scenes that really draws in the viewer.

For the characters, they are as amazing as the first season, where we keep getting highly detailed characters with great character progression. The characters are very consistent with the first season, where we now see them continue through new dilemmas and conflicts. We see how the characters are put in situations where they show their true side or are forced to face their problems, where they have to get through it or give up. This is not only done for the major characters, but is also shown for the side characters which helps build up the main characters, but also gives the whole show a really detailed feel to it. Overall the characters are just done right, they have their own personality, they show progress and feel like real people struggling with their own problems.

The show is also very well known for its high quality animation, which continues in this season. The animation keeps a high quality in both fast paced scenes and more intimate scenes. Both types of scenes are also supported by its artistic styles, used as symbolism to help viewers get a visual understanding for complex emotions or situations that the characters find themselves in. They also show great detail in their animation when it comes to both big and small movements, which overall helps keep the viewer invested in every second of the show.

Music has also been a big part of Oshi no Ko, for this season the music is still great but have taken a turn to songs that feel more aligned to the arcs we follow this season. This means the songs are more focused on the hard feelings characters have to go through, and less focused on the glorified idol world.

To conclude it all, can i without a doubt say it's a great season, where we get to see the plot continue, characters evolve and experience both the beautiful animation and the powerful music. So if you liked the first season can i without a doubt recommend you watch this season too."
55791,539572.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Honestly, I'm not usually a fan of the drama genre, but this work of art has completely blown me away. It's the most beautiful, intriguing, and masterful thing I’ve seen in years outside of the action and isekai genres. The theater arc did an amazing job of helping us understand and explore both new and returning characters in Oshi No Ko. The dialogues are filled with emotion and depth, making every interaction incredibly impactful. I had chills almost every episode, which only increased my anticipation for the next one. I have no regrets about watching the second season—I’m a fan of the first season, and Ienjoyed both the first and second seasons immensely. I’m eagerly awaiting the third season, hoping it won’t be the last, as there’s so much more to learn about the Oshi No Ko universe.

The soundtrack, opening, and ending themes are simply spectacular. I enjoyed them so much that I even added the tracks to my playlist.

My verdict: 10/10."
55791,539603.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Oshi no Ko season 2 is a major step up from season 1. The quality of season 1 dropped after the first episode, in my opinion. This season provided real intrigue, rather than by the numbers ""here's how the industry works"" and ""being an idol is hard"" stuff that's been done to death (just watch Perfect Blue for that). There was still some, but it was properly balanced with more gritty bits. My only major complaint is that the theater arc took too many episodes to wrap up. I wasn't interested in the side plot involving the mangaka, and I'm sure that character will never appearagain. 

Ruby's character development was much needed in this season. She had very little in the first season, and the first half of the second. Oshi no Ko is at its best when it delves into its horror elements, so please keep it coming! Unlike with season 1, the second half of season 2 had me wanting more, now!

The animation, music, and sound were great as per usual with Oshi no Ko. I particularly appreciated the abstract animation sequences with Ruby and Akane's inner thoughts. 

I liked this season's OP a bit more than the first, but that's likely an unpopular take. The ED was great as well. 

Overall, I'm feeling a strong 7 for this season. Had the last arc been a bit longer, it could have touched a light 8. I'm liking what I'm seeing, please keep it up for season 3!"
55791,539581.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"As a manga reader I knew everything about this season from the start. But if you haven't read the manga, you're going to get a lot of twists in this season. Many new faces are seen in this season. I never thought I'd enjoy it so much despite getting the spoiler. Talking about the animation quality, Doga Kobo has done a great job. Speaking of characters, I found some of the characters here to be pretty stupid, but you might like them. Because this is my personal opinion. But as always my favorite character Arima Kana's character has developed a lot. Also now you will seesomething new in Ruby.
Here at the beginning, the anime starts with an extraordinary theatrical production (Tokyo Blade). Also along with the main character's revenge mindset, some romantic moments and the plot twist made the whole anime a lot more awesome than last season. 
Maybe not everyone likes this type of anime. Because everyone likes different genre. I'm an action genre lover. But despite that, I really enjoyed this season. For me 9/10"
55791,539578.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"So I have to be honest, while I *loved* the first season - and I really did love it, my rating for it is a 10 (which is a rating I am very reserved with), I also loved it because of the ""gimmick"". What I am trying to say is that it was a season where I felt there were a few incredible, top tier episodes that rank as among the best episodes I have ever seen across all of TV, but then the rest of the season could often feel a lot more average in comparison. There was sloppiness to it, some amazing highsthat hit fantastically well, but the rest of it wasn't coming together quite that well.

So I was not sure whether I'd be able to love the second season too. Obviously the gimmick, the element of surprise, was gone. You can only do that once. Now the second season would have to stand on the basis of its story, plotting, pacing, characterization and interactions, theming, and I simply wasn't sure if it would be able to do that as well. And for the first couple of episodes, it honestly felt like it wouldn't be able to. The first couple of episodes feel very flaccid and sloppy, and it felt like my worst fears regarding this season would be coming true.

But this season really hits its strides from there on out. The theatre arc is used to do some fantastic psychological deep dives into a lot of characters, new characters are introduced, and new dynamics and interactions are seen, new harsh realities about the entertainment world are learnt, new relationships are formed while existing ones grow and evolve. Oshi no Ko is often at its best when it turns a lens to the realities of the entertainment world, and season 2 is another unflinching look at how uncompromising and brutal on the very creatives that fuel it the world of Japanese entertainment truly can be. Oshi no Ko is often at its best when it delves into the psyches of its characters - and season 2 does this repeatedly, multiple times, with multiple characters.

And obviously there is the larger story. It takes its time to get to it, but Oshi no Ko's second season does finally start to move things along as far as the bigger plot line goes. I don't want to delve into any specifics, but there are multiple holy shit moments, multiple scenes and reveals that gave me goosebumps, as the narrative context, the visual framing, the animation, and the music all swelled to a crescendo of realization and the weight of the moment upon me. 

And yes, like the first season, this is a beautifully drawn and animated show, with multiple frames that are works of art in their own right, and a lethally effective use of music that could positively be weaponized into a form of emotional warfare. The new opening and ending hold up their ends of the bargain, bringing a fantastic new flavour to set the stage and close things out respectively. Opinions will be divided on whether or not these are better than the first season's now iconic ones (personally, I think Season 1's Idol is a better opening than this season's Fatale, and I think this season's Burning is a better ending than Season 1's Mephisto), but that doesn't really matter, the broader point is they're fantastic nonetheless.

And really, that's what it comes down to. Do I like this second season more than the first season? To me it is - it is comprehensively better executed on every single front across the board, it addresses the first season's weaknesses while building on its many strengths, it is far more consistent, with far fewer lulls than the first season (and the lower points being better than the lower points in the first season were), and it has its own incredibly high highs - they don't match the impact of season 1's highs, but they are *very* great regardless, and it all balances out to me preferring the second season overall. But I can very well understand why someone might prefer the first season - the first season at its best is *amazing*, and if it resonates with you in those moments, few other things can measure up to that. 

All of which is to say, both of these are amazing seasons. You aren't guaranteed to like season 2 more than season 1 (I do, sure, but that doesn't mean you will). But even if you don't, you're going to love it a lot regardless. Oshi no Ko is 2/2 now with two top tier peak seasons of television. I can't wait to see what Season 3 brings to the table."

Seriously, watch the information closely I'm a designer, and one of the sagas presents details that I really liked having covered. While in the same saga, facts happen that make the saga a little long,tiring, but, knowing that the plot is good, This is normal, and for me it is one of the facts that makes me give it a 9

55791,539793.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Oshi No Ko is by far the best modern anime about the entertainment industry. You'll see a lot of happy faces and good/bad acting mixed with the dark sides the viewers don't usually see on screen. While you get to experience a strong and solid build-up in season 1 things will slow down quite a bit for season 2 (or do they...?) Judging season 2 by itself I have to give my personal experience which was mostly thinking about how much they talk things through to a point where I couldn't follow as much as wanted. You're slowly drifting away from the twins' story towards a fantasyland of Hollywood where your dreams come true only to wake up from that tiny bit of information needed to progress or have the next mental breakdown. When you jump up and down on your seat while tearing up from excitement about what just happened - that's when you know you are more than invested into the story and characters.

There are a few examples of perfect music like Bleach where goosebumps are basically included in the fight scenes only with sound. Then there's Re:Zero to sometimes not even have an ending playing for a specific episode because someone knew it would instantly break your immersion. Oshi No Ko has a simple yet complex answer to that: Start an episode with opening, end the episode with ending. Complex for this means each episode you will be greeted with an overall opening that makes sense throughout the season but also the ending that somehow fits to every episode. Sound and ambience are not really noticeable but that's exactly what the viewer needs. Small helpers for powerful scenes to have an even stronger impact."
55791,539900.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I enjoyed this season even more than the first. The focus the first half of this season gives on how a manga adaptation to another medium is made and all the problems that arise from it is probably my favourite part of the entire show so far. Couple that with a second half that sets up the mystery surrounding the main characters while breaking them and developing them and you honestly have a show that can be a main stay for years to come Not only is this show a great exploration and commentary on the show industry in japan (everywhere,really, but it's main focus isthere) but it also has amazing character work and sets up very interesting plot details for next season. All while having amazing visuals, storyboarding, animation, music and pacing. I can't recommend this show enough"
55791,539551.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Note - This review does not contain spoilers of this season, but does contain spoilers of the previous one! I love Oshi no Ko, but I feel like this season is a bit of a letdown compared to the last. What makes Oshi no Ko so different than the typical idol / showbiz anime is that it's anything but lighthearted. It has a strong dark side, about murder and vengeance. The first season ended with Aqua joining a stage play for the sole purpose of identifying his father, who is presumably the person behind the killing of his mother Ai, as well as himself in his pastlife. This season picks up from there.
The main issue with this season is that the vast majority of it is the preparation for the stage play and the play itself, which really feels like an average showbiz anime, one of those that you've seen one you've seen them all. The season only picks up around the 9th episode, and only then it becomes as enjoyable as the first season.
I understand that they probably wanted to stick to the source material as much as possible, which I generally consider a good thing - I don't like it when anime cuts a lot of things, but I still wander whether arc that doesn't seem very important had to take two thirds of the season.
Anyway, a 3rd season has already been announced, and at the very least the last five episodes of this season are very much worth watching and will definitely be needed to understand it. Go ahead and watch, but keep in mind that the first eight episodes might feel somewhat boring."

What an incredible anime, full of twists and turns, it brings out all sorts of emotions, from happiness to sadness, sometimes stressful... It's a total success ! And we can only look forward to a third season. Thanks to the producers and the whole cast !! The animation and drawings are incredible. The reproduction of the faces with the manga is perfectly done. This is a truly touching anime, which takes viewers into another world. I advise everyone to watch this anime and say what they think of it so that we can hopefully have more seasons!"
55791,539529.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"[Spoiler-free summary]: In a landscape where anime often struggle to maintain momentum beyond their debut seasons, Oshi no Ko stands out as an exception. Season 2 of this series builds upon the foundation of its first season and elevates it to new heights. The show intertwines themes of psychological trauma, complexities of the entertainment industry, and the lingering threads of a murder mystery. While some may miss the murder mystery elements, this change ultimately enriches Aqua's journey. Although it suffers from pacing issues and some underdeveloped characters, overall, this season surpasses its predecessor and leaves you excited for what Season 3 will bring. [Full review; SPOILER ALERT]: Acommon critic of this second season is that the series seems to veer away from its original plot of Aqua seeking to unveil the mysteries surrounding his biological father, and to exact revenge for his late mother, Hoshino Ai. However, I found this change in narrative to be refreshing, and in fact, beneficial to Aqua’s character development. The traditional revenge narrative is somewhat predictable. We would’ve followed the journey of a character who becomes so consumed by their desire for vengeance that they become a husk of nothing but rage and hatred. They spiral down a dark path, sacrificing everything for the sake of that one goal. By stepping away from this narrative, season 2 of Oshi no Ko manages to develop Aqua into a more nuanced, and realistically human character, who wishes to be free from pain and suffering. Moreover, this shift brings about themes of healing, moving forward, and letting go. Aqua’s personality is not limited to a singular obsession with vengeance. Instead, he seeks to find a path of happiness and fulfilment that isn’t dictated by his trauma.

Speaking of Aqua, I have to say that his character arc in this season plays a huge role in the success of it. The series does an excellent job of showcasing the psychological impact of his traumatic childhood. Aqua’s PTSD manifests in various ways — flashbacks, anxiety, conversations via his inner monologue. What stands out to me is the way the series navigates the theme of guilt, and its accuracy in portraying the way trauma survivors experience it. Aqua constantly grapples with the tormenting belief that he failed to protect his mother, and as such, believes that he doesn’t deserve to be happy. Aqua’s healing journey is not portrayed as linear either. The show accurately captures the challenges he face, and the improvisations he has to make to work around his debilitating mental illness. The season also delves more deeply into the emotional aftermath of Ai's death. It’s poignant exploration of loss and how it can ripple through the lives of those left behind brought tears to my eyes multiple times. This was also achieved particularly through Aqua. With this shift and focus on Aqua’s character, season 2 of Oshi no Ko manages to turn Aqua into someone who resonates better with the audience (because let's be honest, how many of us out here have actually lost a mother at age 2, and are filled with a desire for revenge on our unknown father? None? I thought so too.) Rather, in this season, Aqua’s psychological landscape of confronting and processing trauma offers a significantly more relatable human experience surrounding guilt, trauma, healing, and self-discovery.

Oshi no Ko works with 3 core themes — complex psychological trauma, the entertainment industry and of course, murder mystery. While I understand that some fans might have gotten into Oshi no Ko for its premise of being a murder mystery and are disappointed by the general lack of detective work Aqua did in this season, the shift towards heavier psychological and human themes worked well for me. For me, Oshi no Ko masterfully balances its 3 core themes, ensuring to dedicate enough time to exploring each of the themes. The characters were brought to life more so in this second season than they were in the first. Since its very first season, the murder mystery aspect, while present, has never taken the central stage in Oshi no Ko. The notion that the Hoshino twins’ dad was behind the murder of Ai was also entirely Aqua’s own speculation. If one dives into Oshi no Ko with the hopes that it will strictly focus on only one of its three core themes, they’re inevitably going to be disappointed. The show is designed to weave the themes together for a more layered narrative, not to be compared against Perfect Blue. While both works explore the darker sides of the entertainment industry, Oshi no Ko does not seek to replicate the psychological thriller that Perfect Blue is. Undermining Oshi no Ko for not delivering a good psychological horror diminishes the significance of its unique narrative because the anime has never aimed to be a psychological horror to begin with. Is it overly ambitious for trying to juggle all 3 themes? Arguably, yes. But does it execute them reasonably well? Arguably, yes too.

As aforementioned, the anime has switched it focus rather considerably to character development and emotional depth this season. The three standout characters for me were Aqua, Akane, and Kana. It was interesting to watch their individual evolutions gel together. Their development isn’t just about individual arcs, but about how they collectively influenced one another and evolved.

Season 1 of Oshi no Ko introduced Akane as an untalented, struggling actress, who only had her studiousness as her redeeming feature. The anime doesn’t neglect to continue with this initial premise that Akane is highly intelligent and preceptive. Rather than relying on obvious and constant exposition, an anime character was for once able to put 2 and 2 together and make a conclusion for themselves that the Hoshino twins are in fact Ai’s children, without needing to have it shoved directly into their faces. In this season, Akane serves as an unwavering support for Aqua. Their bond deepens and Akane’s presence offers Aqua emotional grounding — a sense of stability amidst the chaos surrounding them. Another compelling aspect of Akane’s character is the realistic portrayal of her relationship with Aqua. They struggle to define the boundaries of their relationship given the complex nature of it. It’s transactional, and one that oscillates between friendship, collaboration, and burgeoning romance. Akane and Aqua embody the reality of human relationships — rarely linear, and always more complex than we would like to think. Akane’s journey in this second season also involves a decent amount of self-discovery. She’s a lot more confident in her abilities as an actress, a stark contrast from how she was in the first season.

Kana was a decent character in season 1, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that season 2 would continue to place emphasis on her development. We delved deep into her past, and how her lifelong dedication to acting has shaped her as a person. She was forced to mature early as a kid, to mould herself into the expectations of the adults around her. We witness how her formative experiences instills in her a sense of responsibility, but yet also leads to a struggle with her own authenticity and vulnerability. She grapples with the fear that she may in fact, not actually be talented at all. Through her interactions with Aqua, her growth becomes increasingly evident. Most noticeably is Kana’s growing honesty about her feelings for Aqua. Unlike in the previous season, where she often masked her emotions by being mean, Kana now expresses her affections slightly more openly and treats Aqua a little bit better, signalling her newfound maturity and confidence.

Visually, Oshi no Ko meets today’s animation standards. Similar to season 1, the animation is fluid and its choice of colour palette is vibrant and striking — fitting of its idol theme. Tatsuya Kitani for the opening theme was about as strategic of a selection as Yoasobi for the first season.

Flaws:

Similar to its first season, the series doesn't shy away from highlighting the reality of the entertainment industry. This season goes beyond the glamorous façade of showbiz, showcasing the behind-the-scenes struggles of manga adaptations and specifically, 2.5D theatre plays. 2.5D theatre plays are a relatively new concept, and while it was interesting to watch and learn about it, this is also where the show stumbles. Pacing is probably the biggest issue that this season had. Particularly in the initial episodes of the season, the flash forward to the actual play was confusing to have as the first episode and felt completely redundant. While flash forwards can be effective storytelling tools, in this specific instance, it seemed to have only complicated the narrative unnecessarily. The decision to spend 2-3 episodes on a seemingly unrelated manga author also felt highly misplaced to me. While I understand that the series wanted to offer an insight into the theatrical niche, it felt excessive and ultimately, unnecessary. The prolonged focus on the two manga authors, their heated exchanges and frantic rush to meet deadlines, etc. felt like fillers. Don’t even get me started on GOA, and Raiden, etc. Imo, a few brief scenes would have sufficed in illustrating the struggles and intricacies of the manga industry while still maintaining focus on our main cast. The pacing issues also persist throughout the exploration of the 2.5D play itself. The flow of it was choppy with a lot of pauses between scenes where the characters yapped to each other, repetitive fight choreography, and constant flashing forwards and backwards.

Another one of the most glaring flaws in Oshi no Ko is Hoshino Ruby. Her character often comes across as lacking depth and personality compared to her more developed counterparts. She plays a crucial role as one of the Hoshino twins and is central to the story, yet she’s very one-dimensional. Unlike Aqua, Ruby's character arc appears to be a lot more stagnant. Her actions often seem driven by surface-level goals, such as pursuing idol life. She’s cheerful, and has a talent for being an idol thanks to her genes from the legendary Ai, and that’s about all there is to her. It has been two whole seasons and Ruby remains the exact same as she has been at the start of the first season. We really only start to see more of Ruby’s development in the very last episode of this season, and we can only hope that we will be able to see more of her in subsequent seasons. However, as Ruby embraces this darker ambition, it raises questions about how her motivations will clash with Aqua's evolving perspective. The tension between Ruby’s desire for vengeance and Aqua’s attempt to find peace will not only shape their individual arcs but also challenge their relationship. It would be fascinating to see how their differing motivations will affect the story’s progression henceforth.

With the exception of Aqua, Akane and Kana, the majority of the other characters in the series suffers the same fate as Ruby. They’re flat and one-dimensional, with not much other than a singular archetype personality tacked onto them. Understandably so, given there’s only so much that an anime can realistically seek to accomplish within a 13 episode one cour.

Other areas the show falls short includes its frequent use of star drawings in our main characters’ eyes, and the random, constant zoom-ins to their eyes. Which, I never did, and still don’t understand the point of. It just comes off as slightly cringey, in which, the same can also be said about the dialogue at times (like Akane proclaiming ""use me"" on multiple occasions and the yapping during the 2.5D play). There are also instances of lazy or convenient scriptwriting such as when the crow steals the key, keeps flying around, and our characters just blindly trudge through literally half the forest to follow it (and it was also a large reason why I found what happened next to be entirely predictable). For 2 teen girls to do this, it just screams zero logic and survival skills.

Conclusion:

Overall, Oshi no Ko’s second season has evolved to embrace a richer narrative focused on its characters and psychological depth. While the shift away from a traditional murder mystery and revenge narrative may not work for some, it enhances Aqua as a character. The series occasionally falters due to pacing issues, underdeveloped characters, and moments of contrived writing, but this show remains a captivating and compelling watch. If you're open to a more character-driven approach that diverges from its initial hook, this season will a definitely be a worthwhile watch that leaves you wishing Season 3 would just air already."

You will definitely get so into this anime very easily. Death Note has alway been my No.2 but honestly speaking its position has been taken here. The story just kept on getting deeper. Throughout the whole experience you will get sucked in it will be like each episode is 5 minutes! The suspense, the drama, the way the story is delivered.

54744,537468.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Tokidoki Bosotto Russia-go de Dereru Tonari no Alya-san is a series that could be a fun romcom, but due to bad decisions from the author after the first episodes, it just doesn’t work. Simply put, the gimmick of this series doesn’t do anything, sure Alya is Russian and she sometimes speaks it, but this doesn’t really change much, it’s like a different kind of tsundere-ism which would be okay, the problem here is that the series obviously breaks what should be the logical use of its premise by making the MC being able to understand Russian, which is stupid, there’s no point in making acharacter talk a different language so no one can get her just to make the MC being able to get her, and the justification about why he can speak Russian is also pretty dumb in itself. I sometimes wonder why working in a gimmick when you’ll just break it right from the start. 

The protagonist is obviously meant to be “literally you”, just look at his introduction and you’ll notice it, oh he watches anime, he is an otaku, now he will play his gacha, and I just wanted to roll my eyes because once again I’m supposed to believe that the most beautiful girl in the class is in love with the MC who has nothing going on for him, and perhaps the author noticed that too and that’s why he also decided to make him someone proficient at everything he tries, you could replace him with Sakuta from Bunny Girl Senpai or Ayanokouji from CotE and it wouldn’t change anything because he is a charismatic god and a genius like nobody else that has ever existed but he NEEDS to hide his power level by being lazy and will only show it from time to time, the fact that he is a otaku is irrelevant, because he isn’t one, he does nothing to actually show it except saying that he is because the audience needs to self-insert as him, and by being called an otaku it makes it easier for the audience to think they are like him. Honestly, I’m not sure why there was a need to do two completely different versions of him in the same character or which one is worse.

If I was more invested in this series I would get shivers by thinking that Alya beating Yuki at the student council elections is completely plausible because she is the main female character and has the MC that can do absolutely everything by her side, because Alya most definitely doesn’t deserve to win it, she breaks down the second the MC isn’t holding her hand to cross the street as if she was a little baby that needs to be taken care of at every moment, there are multiple examples of this like the baseball club and football team, she needed to be saved by the MC despite the fact that that this is her job in the student council because she is the treasurer, she cannot even do that correctly and I just can’t see why she should win, maybe she’ll be able to actually stand in her own two feet at some point in the future, but even if she does how is she supposed to compete with Yuki when she actually has experience since she won in middle school? Alya was originally characterized as someone who is just so above everyone else and that only she is competent and that’s why she is alone, which barely explains why this girl who gets so much attention as the “solitary queen” has no friends, but she isn’t able to pull off things alone, it makes it funny when she got called out by the glasses girl that she was a pretty face with good notes and nothing more, because that’s true. We just get constantly told by the MC and the series that she is a hard worker and that you should support her for it, but we never see that being close to reality. Of course, this problem wouldn’t exist if the author didn’t add the student council plot to take over everything about the series, because it is easily the worst part about it. 

Which takes me to the absolute best point of this series, that is, Yuki. She singlehandedly carried the show by being an actual character and not the boring and lazy attempt at making a tsundere that is Alya, from her way of talking being so polite that the subtitles cannot even begin to show that her manner of speaking would make a butler blush, and then when in private with her brother she is basically a brocon, playful and actually bounces well with the MC. Honestly, I agree with the glasses girl that they are the perfect duo and the show would be much better if she was the main girl because she got actual chemistry with him, even if she couldn’t salvage how shit the student council stuff is. She is actually fun to watch when she isn’t being serious, and when it comes to the student council presidential election, she actually has drive and ambition and will do terrible shit just to win, for example, using Alya’s own foolishness against her was actually nice and was basically playing 4D chess the entire episode, which seeing how stupid the other characters are, is not even surprising how she pulled it off. Even if she wasn’t easily the most entertaining thing about the series by a landslide, it’s not like she got much competition, Masha is not a character, she was a plot device to make the MC learn Russian because they met in the past, but that isn’t relevant, because they don’t do anything at all with that information because the MC doesn’t know she is her childhood friend, the fact that she knows and decides to do nothing about it and just let Alya have the MC makes all of this irrelevant as you aren’t even getting something out of it, just as an example.

Telling you that the first two episodes were the best part of this series would be the truth, after that, it jumped to Alya’s “sad” past and then to student council shenanigans which I honestly cannot care much about, it could be an actually entertaining romcom when it tries, which is almost any Yuki scene, but the fact that the gimmick it had is basically thrown to the side to the point Alya won’t speak in Russian in some episodes tells you everything that you have to know about the series, “the main girl is a Russian” is an extremely weak gimmick, so I’m not sure if the author actually thought about making this a full-fledged series in the first place. Honestly, this should’ve just been the Yuki show, that would’ve been great, but sadly it isn’t, instead we’re stuck with this bad excuse of a tsundere and a perfect self-insert MC.

Thank you for reading."
54744,537474.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Calling 'Summer 2024' a ""rare"" season for anime might be an understatement. The overwhelming number of romance-centric shows made it truly exceptional. Two of these new romance shows even overshadowed the well-established popularity of ""Oshi no Ko"" to some extent. One of them was ""Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings In Russian."" So, where does this show stand compared to classic rom-coms? Does it have enough substance to be a top recommendation? Or is it just another generic romance that tries to do everything but fails to deliver convincingly? Art and Animation (8.5/10): Let's begin with the animation and art style, areas that likely won't significantly alter public opinion.While the art style and character design were great, Alya, in particular, stands out as one of the most visually appealing waifus of 2024. Her striking appearance is crucial for two reasons: first, as the titular character and primary heroine, her design sets the tone for the show. And......I will talk about the second reason a bit later.

The other characters also looked fine, closely resembling their light novel counterparts. The studio did an admirable job in this respect.
The animation quality was above average for a romantic comedy anime. The twelve distinct ending songs, each with its unique visuals, were a noteworthy feature. Although mostly static, they required more effort than a single ending sequence.

Plot(6.5/10):

Let's be real. ""Roshidere""  fails to distinguish itself from the sea of generic romantic comedies. The narrative lacks depth, failing to deliver a truly original story or effectively utilize the intriguing setting it presents. Roshidere is a tale of missed opportunities, filled with countless ""could have beens"" and ""should have beens.""


Despite the elements at the author's disposal, the transition from light-hearted to serious moments felt forced. The comedic moments, especially those featuring Yuki, were good. But not all of them worked for me. For example, the hypnotism scene felt weirdly out of place. It was clearly fan service, but it didn't justify how abrupt it was considering the previous serious conversation between Nonoa and Masachika.

The serious elements were done pretty well, but the characters' buildup and motivation still felt lacking. It's probably largely due to the anime's failure to place scenes and incidents in an order that would intensify the main focus: the student council election, not the comedy or the relationships. In its 12-episode run, 'Roshidere' used tropes that have been used many times before. So there's barely anything unique about it, except for Alya's occasional Russian sentences. 

Does that mean the plot of 'Roshidere' is bad? No, but it does mean you shouldn't expect anything deep from this show's first season at least. Whether it be complex issues, intense drama regarding relationships, or chaos-creating comedy, this show tries to have a piece of all those but fails to achieve a balance. In short, 'Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian' so far gives off the vibe of an average rom-com.""


Characters(6/10): 

 
I won't be talking about the side characters who barely had any focus put on them in the anime. For example, Ayano, Masha, Taniyama- they had their moments but not enough to be critiqued or praised for their character depth, background, and archetypes.

So, it all comes down to three characters: Alya, Masachika, and last but not least, Yuki.

Yuki: If you ask me what character I enjoyed most watching this season, I'd probably say her name. So, what makes her character funny and likable at the same time? First of all, she's an otaku, secondly she breaks the fourth wall, thirdly she's sadistic, and fourthly she works as a wingman sometimes. If I list these reasons separately like this, it won't really do justice to Yuki's character. She was fun to watch precisely because whenever she got the chance, she did something that we least expect from a little sister character. She had that surprise in store for the audience. And since I'm trying to avoid giving out spoilers, I won't be talking about her family issues.

Masachika: I'm on the fence about his character. While his interactions with Alya are refreshing and he's not the stereotypical clueless rom-com lead, I find the constant reminders of his child prodigy status a bit overdone. It's like a magic trick that loses its luster once you know the secret. The 'child prodigy to laid-back high-schooler' transformation feels like a gimmick that's been overplayed.

Alya: Speaking of gimmicks, Alya's occasional use of Russian as a language barrier is an intriguing tactic, though not quite as impactful as the hour-long looped video released by 'Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan'(That was a marketing masterstroke in my opinion). While her occasional Russian dialogue doesn't significantly alter the story, it's a shared responsibility between her, Masachika, and the author. The author's decision to have Masachika pretend not to understand Russian adds a layer of complexity that could have been explored further.

As for Alya as the main heroine, she's fallen short of expectations. Her character seems primarily driven by her physical appearance, with limited development beyond the typical tsundere trope. While her final speech was a step in the right direction, it doesn't fully compensate for missed opportunities for independent growth. Her reliance on her looks can be seen as a way to compensate for her lack of assertiveness and social skills, which are crucial for a student council candidate. Her interactions with Masachika mirror a typical tsundere relationship. Whether you find her behavior endearing depends on your personal preference for the archetype. Personally, I'm not a fan of tsundere characters, so I don't have strong feelings about her bashful or jealous tendencies, but I do find her lack of directness somewhat frustrating.


Audio and Soundtracks (7.5/10): 

I'm not a Russian speaker, so I can't comment on Alya's accent. And since she barely spoke Russian, it's not a major concern. That said, Sumire Uesaka is a talented voice actress, and the overall voice acting was satisfactory.

The opening song was great. However, I have mixed feelings about using 12 separate ending songs. It limits their memorability compared to having a single ending song or one for each  female character, like ""Monogatari"" . Regardless, the Haruhi ending was a highlight, motivating me to rewatch the series.


Overall(7/10):

 While 'Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings In Russian' isn't entirely groundbreaking, it offers its share of strengths. However, these are often overshadowed by the weaker aspects of its first season. With the announcement of season 2, I'm hopeful for significant improvements in the storyline and character development. There's still plenty of room to explore family dynamics and Masha's past relationship with Masachika. I'm eagerly anticipating the release of the second season.

As for whether or not I recommend this anime, it depends on your preferences. If you're a fan of the genre, I think you'll enjoy it. However, if you're not particularly into rom-coms and are looking for the best introduction to the genre, I'd recommend ""Love is War"" instead.

Thank you for reading. (If you read the whole thing) :)"
54744,537471.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Taking on a somewhat unique gimmick for a rom-com show, Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian is exactly how it sounds like. Alisa Mikhailovna Kujou (aka the ""solitary princess"") is a difficult girl to approach because she sometimes hides her true feelings in Russian. As strange as that might sound, she doesn't realize that her fellow classmate Masachika Kuze understands her. Delivering on the promise of a rom-com, it should be obvious to the audience that Alya harbors feelings for Kuze. Expressed sometimes in Russian, she builds a wall around herself whenever her feelings surfaces. From day one, the anime wants us to understand Alya'spersonality. It's no surprise that she loves to tease Kuze without knowledge that he understands Russian. Kuze plays along and sometimes feigns igornance although most of the time, we see his shocked reaction. The show builds on this pair's relationship through these circumstances and sets the main foundation of the story.

One of the main strengths of the show is its colorful character roster. The main characters Alya and Kuze get their background storytelling but a decent amount of screen time is also given to others such as Yuki, Maria, and later Ayano. The most noticable among the female character cast is Yuki who loves to tease Kuze. Even as a sibling, it's strongly implied that Yuki may have a brother complex while relentlessly trying to get Kuze to react to teasing. Deep down, the two share a close relationship that often serves as a comedic element of the show. At school, Yuki acts more like an elegant model student who others look up to. While at home, she acts like a spoiled kid who wants attention. It's kind of the classic sibling relationship that is treated with humor filled with popcorn entertainment moments. And to be honest, that's a delight.

Should you expect a love story? While this show adapts romance into its story, don't expect the anime to play out like some dramatic shoujo. The romance is just a part of it, where the plot also indulges on the school elements. The most prominent among this is the student council and and its elections. While some school rom-coms adapts these loosely and ties it up within an episode or two, this becomes a recurring plot that serves with significance. Taking place at Seirei Academy, the student council president position is viewed as a role of pride and honor. The main rivalry builds between Alya and Yuki and throughout this rivalry, we see tension around that venture into their personal lives. Indeed, the anime loves its comedic moments among the main cast. However, when the election gets involved, we see character rivalries reach their apex. The only downside appears to be a loose and incomplete adaptation. Given the show's length of 12 episodes, it couldn't focus on all aspects of the election plot. Thus, this anime fundamentally adapts the election to highlight some emotional moments but falls short on its main execution.

However, even if you're not sold on the plot, this show shines most with its character personalities and chemistry. Yuki's on-screen chemistry between Yuki and Alya is a recurring gag that is undeniably entertaining. One might say the recurring moments gets repetitive in nature, but overall, it ignites their personalities. I mean, who wants to see cardboard characters that act like on autopilot? No, we want to be entertained by what see. Even characters such as Ayano can be unintentionally amusing with her stoic appearance and robotic-like mannerisms. The only character I do feel like it's lacking may be Maria. We do short glimpses of her flashbacks, but it undersold in terms of characterization. Out of all the main female cast, her chemistry with Kuze and others is overshadowed. 

Studio Doga Kobo has a long history of adapting rom-coms to the screens and has earned the audience's trust. Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian is adapted with care and commitment. There's no drop in production quality throughout the entire run of the show. Character designs for the female cast is especially decorated with elegant features, most prominently Alya and Yuki. Their expressions has variety and while some might some says have similar face models, they stand out like larger than life characters. The OP theme song is exceptionally spellbinding with colorful chereography while dressing up characters in countless ways. There's also theme songs for every episode highlighting the elegance of the cast, most noticably Alya. She's the title character after all and deserves to be the poster girl.

Watching this anime from beginning to end has given me a new insight on rom-coms in recent years. Sometimes, it's just fun to see character chemistry and not worry too much about the story's drama. Sure, this sure has its drama but it ultimately did what it said out to do. Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian may not be able to compete for anime of the year, but it has the traits of an entertaining rom-com."
54744,537513.0,3.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"This awkwardly titled adaptation of a light novel is a standard well-produced romcom with quite a few tropes and a slight twist using the Russian language. The concept seems weird at first, since the main understands the language, and you'd think he'd let on that he understood, but he'd look like a bigger cuck than he already is if he revealed that he didn't follow through with Alya's ""secret"" flirting all that time. For the Russian lines, she mostly compliments the MC, confesses her love to him, or calls for help when she's in trouble. The whole point of a tsundere is basically for thelove interest to act like they're in kindergarten and do or say mean things to the crush whom he or she secretly likes. Tsunderes have a hard time directly expressing their feelings, but they give a lot of hints, yet their aggression will often keep even the most confident at bay.

Of course, due to the main understanding Russian, her occasional quips in Russian that reveal bombshells, and even some internal monologuing, Alya is pretty much a broken—half or quarter at best—tsundere or a kind of diet tsundere. She occasionally hits him or calls him an idiot, but she is mostly bland, not offering much else other than to allow a peep at her feet or a yawn-inducing ""indirect kiss"" or a quick tease without any memorability. While the language twist might be novel, the author doesn't exploit it effectively. It's either not used enough or feels like a crutch for the writer after a while. About the only other thing to say about Alya is that she has an oh-so-dramatic ""must protecc!!"" cringe backstory to wring sympathy and boohoos out of the viewer, where she's always trying her best but is dismayed by how she can't rely on anyone else, leading to her ""tsundereism"" and romantic interest in the MC. By this point, the comedic focus of the early portion of the series gradually slips away in favor of a snoozy tonal shift, wherein the author attempts to inject drama and interpersonal conflict with a lot of ""feels,"" but the writing is too lightweight to be emotional or gripping, and the standard ""what's your breast size,"" insults, awkward situations, and other jokes aren't exactly fresh.

Worst of all about the language gimmick is how the quirk is often plain annoying, as the MC laughs nervously, rarely acting upon what he hears. He's your typical self-insert MC but not too scummy or anything. Though a mommy complex-induced slacker and otaku, he's an efficient powerhouse when he finds some reason to be committed to a cause. You know, the old routine of pandering to the audience with an OMG just-like-me personage while nodding to some presumed hidden power level or competence. There's a lack of honesty or insight coming from the MC for why he does anything, despite Alya being far too easy to waifu-up with, making the MC seem like the biggest beta orbiter and panty-sniffer on the block. Actual line from the MC: ""Anyway, I want a girlfriend who can also be my best friend."" Either a woman wrote this, or the author is trying too hard with his NTR fetish.

Even with a generic MC and busted tsundere, the series could be salvageable, but we have to talk about the rotting elephant carcass in the room. The student council plot is the most soporific form of moeshit bureaucracy out there. What the author does here is neither interesting nor entertaining. We went into this series looking for a tsundere romcom, but we often instead get, ""Send the treasurer over to the clown club to ensure they're not exceeding their budget"" or long speeches and debates meant to look professional but acting as a stand-in for a literal cat fight between two badly behaved girls.

Many scenes involving the student council have the austerity of walking into a local congressional meeting and trying to stay awake, but nothing they do really matters. I soon forget I'm watching a romcom instead of C-SPAN, just with cute and incompetent girls rather than old coots with dentures. Aside from being a slog, it's also oddly emasculating: Despite cutting into his anime and slacking time, the MC gets roped into joining the student council to fulfill his cuck aspirations of catapulting his waifu into the role of president; he props her up like he's a footstool with an inferiority complex, which was the same role he had for his backstory. Why does he want to promote her to being the president? He gives no special reason, but if Alya found a bf, the MC would probably drop out of the student council immediately.

The only decent character, Yuki, has a two-faced role as a prim and proper presidential candidate for the student council but moonlights as an incestuous otaku. Yuki is certainly a wittier character than a mere ice princess puppet with good grades like Alya, and the idea of the latter winning against the former in an election is preposterous. Probably the only other important character is Alya's sister, Maria, but she's pretty much the touchy-feely mommy who functions as a forgotten childhood friend for the MC and a wistful cheerleader for her sister. Her character is the equivalent of guzzling a gallon of corn syrup, and she's a fine example of why the childhood friend love interest almost always fails.

The writer attempts to run autopilot on fetish fuel to make up for the dull as dishwater romcom (plus drama dumpster dive) plot and character dynamics that we've seen endlessly but runs out of the diluted fuel he plies upon us all too fast. Alya, being the lukewarm diet soda that she is, runs out of fizz after about two episodes, and the author overcompensates with his sister fucker fetish and accidentally makes an entertaining character in Yuki, though it might leave those with more touristy sensibilities squirming in their seats, even if it's pure incestbait, and she has no more of a chance than the childhood friend. All of these factors make the faint love geometry nearly nonexistent.

If there were video games representing the quality of the two main grills, one would be succinct and straightforward: Super Spicy Sister Fucker 4 (Yuki). The other would be a long, unwieldy, LN-like title: Boring Fake-Ass Broken Tsundere Gives You a Clammy Handshake in the Backroom of the Student Council while Rambling in Russian that You Pretend not to Understand (Alya). I'm starting to think this should be advertised more as a siscon series with a whole hell of a lot of filler rather than a tsundere romcom, or Yuki should have her own spinoff. You know a ""tsundere"" anime is subpar when you're rooting for ""wincest."""
54744,537462.0,3.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Long title, name of the heroine slapped on top, and a slight twist that makes up the girl's entire personality, Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian is everything wrong with the contemporary anime/light novel scene. It's the same old romcom story told in a different way, this time, particularly cringe. Bottom line is, Roshidere is a show written by a degenerate, for degenerates: its characters over-analyses, over-dramatises, and of course, are over-sexualised. The pain point that makes this show especially insufferable is the utter sincerity in which the cast do and say the most disturbing and idiotic things, yet we are supposed to believe theystudy in one of the most prestigious high schools in Japan.

The story often side-tracks and whatever happens in the show happens because it would work as a device to serve to deliver on a trope, a gag, or fan service, with very little exceptions. What results is a story that feels, to put it generously, inorganic and stiff. As opposed to the characters driving the plot forward, things happen in the show for the characters to ""have a moment"". Perhaps the most infamous example here is the hypnosis scene in episode 7: the Mikhailovna sisters literally start stripping at school in the middle of the day, and for what? Novel readers might argue that the scene is a vital device to deliver on critical foreshadowing (no spoilers, you'd have to guess), I disagree. That is but a by-product of what is otherwise a scene dedicated to be otaku-bait fan service, and if the author really wanted to do foreshadowing, there were a million other more tasteful ways to do it. The anime is filled to the brim with these blocks of disconnected trope-filled scenes that the author tries so badly to smash together, and oftentimes, it's just bad fan service.

That brings us to the problematic elephant in the room. Now, one can of course appreciate a fan service scene if it's well-executed. To this, Yuki's ""good morning, my brother"" in episode two comes to mind: the nonchalant attitude of Kuze towards his sister serves as good character building and a funny meta gag by contrasting the audience's reaction from his own. But the majority of these scenes in Roshidere stand in stark contrast to that moment of brilliance. Instead, fan service in Roshidere is often awkward with no satirisation, no thematic, characterial, or plot significance, only pure titillation designed to arouse your average anime viewer. Within the same episode, for example, Roshidere decides to show us multiple angles of Alya changing when trying out different clothes in the store; or in episode five, when Kuze stared into the breasts of the two sisters during PE lessons. The show constantly jumpscares you with unwarranted and uncomfortable scenes that are simply not for anyone with a developed brain.

And this fundamental issue for Roshidere runs even deeper: the story—and hence, the fan service the author so desperately wants to add—needs to focus on Alya; yet, the awkward relationship dynamic she has with Kuze, the POV character and protagonist, makes for some mind-numbingly stupid and boring sequences. Let me give an example. Halfway through episode one, Alya takes off her socks in front of Kuze in the middle of a serious conversation and asks him to put on new ones for her. Predictably, she is too ashamed to carry through with it, and predictably, the remainder of the whole episode is dedicated to this pointless exercise of Kuze getting back on good terms with Alya. This chronic lack of chemistry between the two are not only highlighted in fan service scenes that the author likes so much, but also brings problems into the main plot.

A show being unequivocally and unapologetically cringe might not a deal breaker for many people (it is for me, but I digress), but even if you can look past that and engage with Roshidere authentically—it's just a bland character drama featuring a low-stakes conflict. The goal of our main duo is to become the student council president, why? Well, we're not sure. All there is to know is Alya's borderline psychopathic backstory and Kuze's mystery secret past somehow powers them to do it. So my big question is, what do Kuze and Alya have to lose if they fail to achieve their goal? Nothing—nothing's on the line for the two except for their ego. They are good friends with all the prospective candidates, so their position in the council is always safe; their relationships aren't at risk either, as long as they can swallow their pride, their friendships with Yuki, Sayaka, Nonoa, or any number of their friends would remain the same no matter if they win or lose. This is not to mention how dull the presidential debates, psychological warfare, or anything related to the election is, but I think I've said enough on that. Ultimately, it's this mundane main plot that breaks Roshidere for me: every episode, I sit down to watch whatever disconnected shitshow had popped into the author's mind, and any resemblance of a well thought out plot or a coherent storyline is heavily undermined by the sheer unimportance of it to the life of the cast. 

Before I get into the only redeemable elements of Roshidere, can I also mention how tiring the ""Alya hides her feelings in Russian"" gimmick is? The author doesn't play around with the concept at all, instead does exactly what it says on the tin, EVERY SINGLE EPISODE, sometimes multiple times in one. I'm so done with the Alya says something in Russian → Kuze struggles to keep his poker face up → Alya laughs at Kuze for not knowing Russian (when in fact she's the clueless one) loop that the author feels mandatory to include every three seconds.

So, a boring and fragmented story, uninteresting main duo, an unexciting main plot, and an annoying gimmick that's repeated to death, what is there to like in Roshidere? Not much. DogaKobo and the voice actors have done an exceptional job, yet even in the production side of things, I have a bone to pick with Roshidere. In the context of being slapped on top of such a poorly planned story, a different ending song for each episode feels like the production pandering to the otaku psyche, so much so to the point it feels patronising. The only way in which it compliments the story well, and not in a good way, is how detached the songs are to the actual content of the episode. 

That is not to say it diminishes all the stuff DogaKobo and the voice actors have done right in Roshidere. Maruoka Wakana really killed it with her impression of Yuki, Itou Routa did a great job in reworking the novel into a script that turns a repulsive read that is the novels into something that's narrowly watchable show, and the team as a whole that has put so much effort into animating this mess. Despite the horribleness that's oozing through the screen everytime I watch this show, their efforts and passion is apparent.
 
Ever since its publication in 2021, Roshidere has constantly topped the best selling light novel charts in Japan. I'm seriously puzzled. Look slightly beneath its hype, what you find is a bad IP that got saved by a decent adaptation that wraps its terrible writing, questionable narrative choices, and lazy characterisation into something that's barely consumable. If you find Roshidere enjoyable, I'm sorry, but you're way lost in the anime sauce, might I suggest touching some grass."
54744,538057.0,5.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"A premise of a tsundere who speaks Russian, where in the end that was her only grace, speaking Russian. Roshidere is a typical school romance where, what is intended to be a breath of fresh air to the genre, ends up being the anchor that ends up sinking it. It focuses so much on giving a spotlight to Alya that it ends up showing all the deficiencies that the character has, and unfortunately she does not have what it takes to carry the work as a protagonist should. Any character that appears within the story is more interesting and more charismatic than its female protagonist. Eventhe episodic characters like the grandfather or Masachika's friends stole the scene when they appeared. If the episodic characters overshadowed Alya, the secondary ones constantly buried her. Yuki and Masha have what it takes to replace Alya as the protagonist but the story wants to force you to see Alya as a person who is at the level of those mentioned above. The story doesn't bother to develop its main girl, and yet they put her in a situation where she has to act but she just stays as the pretty face.

Giving so much weight to the plot of the school elections and giving us the backgrounds of Yuki and Masachika, automatically give more weight to the skills and ingenuity than to simply being a one trick pony. Masachika tries hard to get the campaign ahead and her greatest enemy is Alya. The girl doesn't even try to put in a grain of effort, she simply limits herself to say sporadic phrases in Russian. It feels like all the characters play in a higher league than Alya, but still something has to be nerfed so that she can even look decent. All this so that in the end the relationship advances only one step.

It also doesn't help that the fandom that was generated around this work has become a cult towards the Russian. There are many things that the same fans who read the novel try to justify with facts that were never shown in the anime but are in the novel. This leads me to classify that the anime failed as an independent adaptation. If the only way in which a discussion related to the anime can be had is with information from the novel, then the failure is huge. If the anime cannot show the core of the story in a satisfactory way, then it is not that good.

One of the most anticipated anime ended up being the biggest disappointment of the season. This anime worked as a promotion for the novel, as it worked for Sumire Uesaka (they forced her in every possible place). It worked as anything you can imagine but it failed in the most important thing, in being a good story."
54744,537464.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"I'm not going to sugarcoat this, I really liked Roshidere. An anime that has vibrant production and character designs doesn't come often, paired up with actual witty dialogue and some good characters. With these strengths, Roshidere could have easily been a recommendation for everyone to take as a fan-favorite rom-com. However, as every episode came later, it couldn't stand to the height of what new romcoms have already achieved. I hoped for it to live up to the qualities of post-modern rom-coms, but sadly it has come to an end. When you hear a studio like Doga Kobo especially if the anime has a cast filledwith female characters, Doga Kobo will surely deliver that level of expectation in creating the cutest waifu material you could find in this Summer arsenal. It's bright, but nowhere to the level of being nauseatic, and the animation is consistent and high-quality for the entire run, Such to say in simpler terms, it's a buffet for the eyes. Although most female characters look oddly the same if you disregard their hair color, styles, and apparel, it's pretty much a waifu fest for anyone intending to find a favorite waifu.

Speaking of Waifus, who would have thought the imouto ended up being the best character in this anime? Yuki Suou is easily the best character and has the most personality out of all the waifus the anime shows on a redundant scale. Despite showing up as a talented, high-class lady who's polite and charming, her scenes with the male MC are just the absolute best to watch, the VA did a magnificent job to make her stand out and has so much taste in comparison to other waifus in this anime. To describe her in a single word, she's just BASED. How can you make a character who's so blatantly 'shameless' not cringe and ACTUALLY charming to watch? That's a big plus for anything I've seen trying to portray Otakus. Her dialogues combined with an incredible voice just make her almost impeccable and a top-tier performance to be beholden.

Likewise, the anime's strongest part is the performance of the voice actresses, and that includes the main voice actress herself. Imagine a voice actress who is so dedicated to Russian culture, that she can speak fluent Russian while doing vocal performances for the opening and different endings. You got yourself a reason to like Sumire Uesaka even more if you didn't watch her previous performance in other anime before. It was like the role was specifically tailored for her.

I think it's enough for the performance praise and actually focus on the anime, as such. I find it discouraging to realize there were more flaws than there were strengths in this anime. The list being:

1. Weak supporting cast
- They are mostly decent on first impression and aren't unlikable, but when you have characters like Yuki or Alya being genuinely likable to watch, the cast pretty much looks stale compared to these powerhouses. Masachika is not by all means a bad character, but by making your male character witty, smart, talented, and hang around multiple girls at the same time like how most male characters are written nowadays, you could change him with another similar male character, and the anime would still proceed without any hindrance. The only reason he's viable to be in the cast was simply because of Yuki's sheer existence (the brother to the most BASED character in this anime).

- I'm not trying to say you should avoid tropes, but I think the anime got a bit too comfy with introducing tropes just for the sake of it. Ayano Kimishima and Masha are the characters I'm speaking of, with the latter being the one I'm genuinely more disappointed in. How are they still churning out maid characters? I don't understand what is so endearing about showing stone-faced ladies looking at you, doing your every bid by any means. You would mostly see her together with Masachika or Suou, only to add a little spice of dialogue to the duo, but even then, I don't see much reason to add her other than to be another fanservice for the audience. Turning to Masha however, I was disappointed with her lack of character development despite being the ONLY character to recognize Masachika from his childhood's past. Her development is nowhere to be seen as later episodes go on, despite signaling her attachment to Masachika. She, unfortunately, falls flat from other characters that have received more depth and attention as the anime goes on.

2. Lack of romance development
- Speaking of development, the romance progression is honestly the reason why the anime can't be recommended as a satisfying rom-com by today's standards. If you would compare it to 2010's romcoms, the anime does it by the book, a perfect anime to define one, but it comes in stale compared to new rom-coms that have better or more accurate 'FASTER' romance progressions than what Roshidere has come to offer. It starts as your regular rom-com would normally start; 

- You get introduced to an eccentric yet charming girl, she shows her personality, the male character feels a bit off but accepts it nonetheless, somehow finds the chance to rizz her, the girl somewhat reciprocates or blushes, male character blushes too from his actions or vice versa, repeat. It's a standard procedure but very effective when you add more features to the romance, leading to drama or conflicts, it could have been a good romance anime.

- The trouble starts when the anime decides to divide the attention between different love interests that might hit it off or pretty much have different appeals for different audiences. The quality screen time that could have been given to Alya is unfortunately divided by other contending waifus who are defined by their tropes alone. It gives the anime a lot of downtime and is pretty frustrating for anyone who's looking for meaningful screen time between the main couple. Even worse, it decided to show the student council election arc, eliminating the majority of romance for even more characters introduced and causing more downtime for romance later to come. Along with adding Masachika's backstory to the picture, you get lesser romance appeal as the later episode goes on. The only thing that stays consistent in the anime is the comedy and fanservice the anime proudly showcases to you in a silver picture.

It is a shame, that I held it in the regard of contesting favorable rom-coms, but the anime couldn't reach the level of what is considered great in romance terms. If you're looking for some fun personalities in anime portrayal, this one would cater to your needs most deservedly, otherwise, you might not be able to find this romance anywhere diabetic."
54744,537525.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Honestly, ""Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian"" ended up being one of the most disappointing anime I’ve watched in a while—not bad, just disappointing. The first few episodes made it seem like it was going to be a fresh and interesting romance, but by the end, it really didn’t live up to that potential. Let me break down why: 1. Romance is mediocre with little development: This is the biggest problem. The relationship between Alya and Kuze barely goes anywhere. (Minor spoiler) By the end of the season, they’re only on a first-name basis, which is pretty underwhelming for a finale. I was expecting something moremeaningful, like Kuze speaking Russian to Alya, but nope. It feels like they’re saving that for season two just to keep people hooked.

2. Student council elections were lame:
The student council elections were a big distraction from what the show should have been about: Alya and Kuze’s relationship. It dragged the story down with a lot of unnecessary drama.  You can even see the change in opinions here on MAL in the discussions, the disparity between the early episodes and later episodes after the council elections is vastly conflicted. It’s not terrible, but it took away from the characters and their development, which was the main reason I (and probably many others) started watching.

3. Has generic cliches:
This is a smaller issue, but the show leans hard into some typical anime clichés. t has the classic ""introverted otaku to chad"" storyline, where the shy male MC is drawn out of his shell by a random 10/10 girl who invades his personal space. It’s not terrible, but it’s been done a million times. Nothing new here, which makes the show feel a bit generic.

Overall, the show isn’t bad, just super over-hyped. I still think it’s decent, and there’s hope that a second season could fix a lot of these issues.
7/10 – Over-hyped, but still worth checking out."
54744,537693.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"YOU ARE NOT IMMUNE TO PROPAGANDA Time to talk about a random rom-com. Surely there isn't any arguing going out on social media about it... Oh... Anyway, I believe that people have been blessed recently with good romance after good romance. It only seems that yesterday people were still talking about ""The dangers of my heart"". And ""Alya-san conveys her feelings in Russian"" seems to be the big rom-com of the summer 2024 season. But is it worth to watch? I believe so. The story starts with a black haired, unmotivated high-school boy (where have I seen that before) sitting next to a Russian girl by thename of Alya-san. Now, let me get this out of the way. The people who are mad that there isn't enough Russian in this show are very stupid. I cannot understand being mad that the gimmicky romance you are watching isn't actually that gimmicky. I swear the people who hate the show for that are just Russian bots who got lost after their ""X"" account got deleted. I was surprised by the story and how dramatic it actually seems. There is a reason I think people have gravitated toward the Masahikas sister rather than Alya herself (other than the fact she is genuinely a more fun character). It's because she is part of this dysfunctional family dynamic that is very interesting. The show quickly show-cases that it has a way more bigger story to tell that it seems, and that the MC i laughed at before may actually have a very complicated and sad background. The idea the there is a bigger story behind the high-school romance  we are seeing is really interesting and fun. I was genuinely stuck to the screen every time a serious moment happened. And I still believe the show has yet to show its full hand.
Still there are some issues with the story. One big one being that the character the show is named after is actually the 2nd most interesting girl in the show (closer to 3rd than 2nd tbh). It's very important in a romance that when you give the viewer the character who will eventually win the heart of the MC without fail, you make the the most interesting character, without a doubt. But so far, Alya-san has fallen short. Also there is a bit of incosistency in how some characters act. Especially Maschika who cannot decide if he is an charismatic, sarcastic genius or an idiot who cant even speak to a girl and get played with again and again.

The animation is decent enough, nothing too crazy but good enough for a romance anime. Another problem I have though is the music. The opening sound like the fucking song that plays when you open Blue Archive and the ending is straight up just bad. And the music through-out the show is pretty basic and bad. I swear this season has been very bad with background noise (Giji Harem and Days with my step-sister) but that is for other reviews. While not impressing on a technical level the show does just good enough.
 
That's why my final rating for ""Alya-san conveys her feelings in Russian"" is a 8/10.
I highly recommend watching this show if you want something good to scratch that romance itch left by all the good shows in the genre recently. It is an interesting story that is bound to pull you in, along with some cute romance scenes that are classic to the genre."
54744,537488.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"First three episodes are really good, but later the focus shifted to story rather than Main characters, Coming to story, it was not particularly good, it is just fighting for power, politics, backstabbing and such stuff, Mature minds may not find it enjoyable, it is just OK, Coming to characters, MC is a chad, FMC is a proud yet idealistic woman, naive to the schemes others employ to achieve their ends. So without spoiling the story is how MC supports FMC to get her goal, that is all, and the title part where she tells something in Russian and MC understands Russian well, butacts like he doesn't understand for FMC to reveal her true feelings towards her. 
In conclusion, while the series isn't a must-watch, it doesn't fall short of expectations either, offering several truly enjoyable moments."
54744,537589.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"9.5/10 (rounded to 10/10) Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian is a near perfect romcom. Despite recycling the old romcom-tsundere trope in a High School setting used countless times in anime, it is still unique and interesting with decent story and retaining all the plot elements one looks for in a romcom. -The art is amazing all thanks to studio Doga Kobo -The MC is very respectable -Alya is a very good FMC with good character development -Good side characters (Masha, Ayano) -Russian is a nice touch But all these above still only makes it an 8/10, so why a 10/10?SUOU YUKI 
She is an AMAZING character, with a great VA. She is the icing in the cake we call Roshidere. She makes Roshidere stand out despite not being the FMC, her interactions with Kuze really bring this show from an 8/10 to a 10/10.
The show does become more serious later on, unfortunately making Yuki fall off a bit later on (-0.5 score), which is alright because this was when Alya shines with her cutesy and wholesome moments more so then before.

Overall despite it's slight downturn from what would have been perfection, this show is still a masterpiece, I will be very excitedly waiting for season 2."
54744,537470.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I wish I could say I liked Roshidere as much as other people did, but sadly at this stage in my life goonerbait doesn’t move me. The anime’s over-reliance on incest bait, sexualisation and fanservice just turned me off at times from what was otherwise an actually decent romcom. I want to be clear, I don’t hate the Roshidere anime. As a light novel reader, I felt it did a lot right and even surpassed the LN in some regards such as Sumipe’s amazing portrayal of Alya which really elevated those Russian speaking moments from the books, Fuze and Alya’s relationship, the student council stuff,the DG art and visuals, etc. But there were quite a few things I didn’t like as well, such as the focus on the brocon gimmick and just how degenerate the show gets at times. Don’t get me wrong, if you’re a casual romcom viewer you’ll probably like Roshidere. It’s genuinely got some fun moments, good characters and the show looks great, I just think it’s attracted the wrong sort of crowd and it’s turned me off to an extent.

I’ve been a big fan of the Roshidere books for a couple years now so when the anime got announced by Doga kobo who are one of my fave studios I was excited. The thing that makes Roshidere in the books so cool is that you’ve got this really nice slow burn relationship between Kuze and Alya that develops, but it’s not the main focus. Instead the focus is on Kuze and Alya both growing as individuals. Alya seemingly has everything going for her. She’s beautiful, intelligent and the envy of the school, yet she’s unable to connect with people and feels alone. Kuze is quite talented himself but is an underachiever. Meeting Alya ends up making him come out of his shell and start putting his talents to use, while he helps improve her social skills, make friends and become someone who people feel that can approach. It’s very much a personal development series first and foremost with the romance secondary and a sprinkling of some fanservice illustrations. The anime does get the Kuze and Alya dynamic down pretty well I think. Every scene of them is so fun and Alya’s tsuntsun gimmick combined with her sweet Russian comments that show her inner thoughts are a joy to watch. I think it’s paced pretty well too so by the end of the season viewers will feel satisfied with the character development.

Honestly my favourite part of Roshidere is the side characters though. Masha, Sayachi, Yuki when she’s not doing her bit, etc., are all pretty fun and add some nice spice to the story. While Kuze and Alya are great, it can get a little repetitive seeing the same couple episode after episode, but I think the author and by extension Doga Kobo strike a good balance here, even adding some anime original scenes in to flesh out characters more. I think there’s someone for everyone among the cast to root for.

Visually Roshidere is stunning, up there with the very best Doga Kobo have done. The colours are so vivid, the animation is fluid, the character designs are great and the direction is really well done too. 

Now I know you’re probably like “ok do you like the anime or not, because you complained about gooner shit and you’ve praised it a lot” and like I said before, it’s a bit of both. I do like large parts of Roshidere. I also dislike aspects of it and the crowd its drawn due to the anime focusing more on goonbait than the books. It’s not a black or white thing. I would still recommend it for romcom fans, degens, people who are into Russian and wanna hear a cute anime girl speaking it etc. I just wish they’d focused on the character development more than moments like “good morning my brother” so much. There’s of course fanservice in the books but it’s much more fleeting than the anime. The anime tends to focus on things a lot more via holding shots and frames, extending scenes from the books etc. I’m not a prude, but I just felt it distracted from the actual character development plot and put the focus elsewhere which is why I complain about that so much. Again, most people won’t care and that’s cool. It’s still a solid anime and worth watching.

Roshidere gets 8 out of 10."
54744,537570.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Roshidere has a very intriguing concept, but in my opinion, it doesn't fully realize its potential and seems to decline with each episode. The show's comedy is top-tier, largely due to the captivating dynamic between Yuki and Masachika. Despite the title focusing on Alya, I felt that these two characters carried the show. During the summer of 2024, an abundance of romantic comedy series flooded the anime industry, leading to oversaturation that hindered the success of other rom-coms during that season. Amidst this competitive environment, Roshidere emerged as a standout exception, largely due to its captivating waifu characters and an approach that resonated with rom-comfans in various ways. The series managed to captivate audiences and carve out its own niche in a market filled with similar content. Nonetheless, it remains one of my favorites this season, particularly because Yuki is one of the most compelling characters I've ever encountered and is truly one of the best female characters of all time. I highly recommend the show to those who love the rom-com genre. I am confident that fans of the rom-com genre will thoroughly enjoy it.

While I enjoyed the chemistry between Kuze and Alya, the central gimmick lost its charm fairly quickly—by episode 4, it already felt stale. The series is filled with cute characters, but most of them lack depth and fail to leave a lasting impression. Kuze ends up carrying much of the show on his own, especially during the second half, which focuses on an underwhelming student council plot. The drama is overly serious for such trivial stakes, making it feel more tediousthan engaging. Ultimately, the show fizzles out and crashes hard. I seriously considered dropping it, but the occasional cute moments and flirty interactions were just enough to keep me watching. I feel like the LN and the manga are much better, maybe its the anime's fault, but it didn't manage to keep me entertained as much as the manga did. Hopefully, the second season adapts vol 3-4, so I don't have to watch 5 more seasons of this."
54744,537654.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"What a way to end the season with the adorable Alya's smile . Huge W . Now then , lets get into it .. ""Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian"" is a charming and heartwarming romantic comedy that brings a fresh and delightful twist to the high school romance genre. It expertly balances humor, heartfelt moments, and a subtle layer of cultural intrigue, making it stand out from the usual love story. The plot revolves around Alya, a cool and reserved girl who hides her true feelings behind a facade of indifference. What makes this even more interesting is her habit of switching to Russian whenshe expresses her more vulnerable emotions, assuming no one understands. Unbeknownst to her, the male lead, Masachika, actually does understand Russian, setting up hilarious and sweet misunderstandings as he quietly navigates her hidden affections.

The dynamic between Alya and Masachika is adorable, full of playful banter, and each scene between them carries a sense of tension and excitement. Alya’s tsundere personality contrasts beautifully with Masachika’s easygoing demeanor, and their relationship develops naturally, without feeling forced. The way the show uses language as both a barrier and a window into Alya’s true emotions is a unique and clever narrative device.

Visually, the animation is clean and appealing, with a focus on character expressions and subtle movements that highlight Alya’s internal struggle to hide her feelings. The use of Russian language in key moments adds an extra layer of charm, creating memorable scenes that stand out in the genre.

Overall, ""Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian"" is a refreshing and endearing take on the romantic comedy genre. Its clever use of language, charming characters, and well-balanced humor make it a hit for fans of lighthearted romance with a twist. It’s a series that feels interesting, and for those looking for something a little different, this anime delivers a delightful experience."

Yuki is obviously the star of the show, but even if she's the best character, I think Alya and Kuzo are a great duo. As for the political stuff with the student council, it's pretty generic, but still interesting solely because of the characters involved. This show won't rock your socks off, but for a rom com it's very enjoyable. The humour is the best part. It's hard to get me to laugh, so if it got me laughing so hard,I'd at least say check it out just for the comedy alone."
54744,537515.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Well here we are, another anime about school and rom-com. This anime is called Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian which gives a unique situation when a girl speak russia to hide her emotion. But yet our masachika understands all what Alya said. This anime fills with excitement and funny interactions between each characters. Beside that, it shows the psychological warfare and strategy tactics to achieve the MC’s goals. Here is the explanation of each part : Story (7/10) I must say that the story is not the best one. Yet it was a decent one. The story is kind of all over the place.At one point it focused on romance, at another point it focused on MC’s goal, and other story aspects. But the story is still enjoyable, even though I think the progression is rather on the unhurried pace.

Art (10/10)

They nailed it on the art. The detail of each character and every body part is well looked after such as lips, eyes, etc. The lighting is so perfect and adjusted to the situation and time background especially in romance scenes. One thing also the comedic animation is still there, still funny but not overpowering funny. The art is one of the superiority of this series. The art in the anime intro is outstanding.

Sound (8/10)
This anime put a lot of effort into the ED songs. The ED songs are so variative in each episode. The opening song is still enjoyable but it is pretty similar to other rom-com opening songs. The background sound they are using is spot on. The seiyuu doing a very great job in the voices, all the voices differ one to another in each character and by recognizing the voice, it displays character personality more strongly. Maybe just the language barrier which uses a bit of Russian language makes the voice of each character kinda off but still that is acceptable.

Character (9/10)
The main character shows some great character personality a little differently than any other anime romcom. It can show fear and some desire that makes it special. The character development of the main character can be seen when the male lead becomes more concerned and the female lead becomes more open and expresses her emotion more often. The antagonist is really good at doing their part by using mind and psychological strategies. The support characters still have a significant part in developing our main character. The support characters also had unique and distinctive personalities.

Enjoyment (9/10)
One of the enjoyment of watching this anime is how much fan service they give to viewers. The fan service with incredible art makes it so enjoyable to watch. Another aspect that is special is that they are using a relatable character to make the viewer connected with their life. Also this anime sometimes uses “breaking the fourth wall” to make the series more interesting and makes viewers invested in it. The comedy is still there and not awkward. The depiction of school is so good especially within the student council organisation. Meanwhile the romance, while still not a lot, it can be seen progressing and when the romance scene appeared, it executed perfectly and makes the viewers feel the love.

Well it seems this anime is overall giving very good experiences to the audiences. It’s kind of a light anime to digest and enjoy. This anime is similar to other rom-com anime but still stood out with their own uniqueness. It delivered some of the great art with passionate voice actors/actresses with a little detail that makes it distinctive from the others such as “breaking fourth wall”, fan service, and beautiful character portraying that makes viewers love each character even the supporting one. I advised you to give it a try to watch this anime too if you like romance comedy anime."
54744,537507.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"To the average anime-viewer, Alya might look like just another harem-like high school romcom, but this show has a lot more going under the hood than at first glance. The characters are phenomenal, and probably the show's best strong-suit. Outside of the 'NPCs' that are supposed to be hidden from the spotlight, every single one has a unique and strong personality without lining up 100% with the usual anime stereotypes. They change, they grow, relationships are built, and some are shaken up. Masachika and Yuki carry the show when it comes to mysterious backstory and the comedic stuff, while Alya and Masha carry just aboutall the 'kawaii' factor that one could hope for. Alya is a great example of a character that is growing and overcoming her own pitfalls, and although sometimes cold or blunt you get a sense of how she is at her core. There are two, maybe even three sides to Yuki as a character, and Masachika also is fighting his own crutches while still giving an OP impression. Overall, great thought and effort was put into the main characters in this show. Kudos to the voice actors for an extremely exceptional performance that brought these characters to life. Let's also not forget the visuals and design being top-notch, applause to the animators and original creators as well. There is not a single time that a character was plain or boring, and it should be praised for such.

While some may criticize the story for being based on the MC being dishonest to the heroine, Masachika appears to be keeping secrets for more reasons than just avoiding awkwardness and it urges the viewer to keep watching. There is one plot-hole that is currently unexplained given Masachika's actions, but one could bet it will be answered in the future season(s) based on some of the backstory that is entailed. This show does not completely rely on fan service nor is it swamped with too many tropes. There is 2 or 3 episodes out of the 12 that give the usual service that viewers are used to, the rest is mainly story progression, comedy, and drama. Would not consider this show to be ecchi or overly lewd. It hits just the right spot in a lot of ways other similar shows do not, and while it may not be as funny as something like Love is War or as fundamentally deep as something like Nier Automata, this show is far more entertaining than the shows of the same caliber/genre and for that it is a one-of-a-kind. 

Side-note: This show will possibly be your downfall in Anime Music Quizzes, opening is good, the 12 endings are a mix of popular Japanese songs covered by Alya's VA and already belong to several other anime such as Haruhi and Takagi."

58059,538859.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Wistoria: Wand and Sword — An infusion of many battle Shonens that both impresses and disappoints, I'm having a ridiculously hard time trying to mix those elements together. Ever since the release of mangaka Yuki Tabata's Black Clover onto the anime scene in Fall 2017, that has since become the NEW de facto standard of the once-Weekly Shonen Jump juggernaut that grew into the big franchise as it is today, it was the camel that broke the straw's back to set expectations for new Shonen works from that point forward. And from that point on, the Shonen genre market has been flourishing all the more, forbetter or for worse, with series like Shingeki no Kyojin a.k.a Attack on Titan reaching its conclusion, Jujutsu Kaisen still raking its fame (though at this point is nothing but the butt of jokes on mangaka Gege Akutami), and the lil' ones like mangaka Hajime Komoto's Mashle: Magic and Muscles having its parody take on the Shonen formula.

And if you need any reason to doubt that the Shonen genre is on its way to death and beyond because of its tried-and-true tropes that authors didn't want to reinvent that formula too much, look no further than Tsue to Tsurugi no Wistoria a.k.a Wistoria: Wand and Sword, serialised in Kodansha's Bessatsu Shonen magazine, and written by one of AniManga's most successful authors: Fujino Omori of Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka a.k.a Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? fame. DanMachi, like Black Clover, has cemented its own success as a long-running franchise since the anime came out back in Spring 2015, and is easily one of the best Shonen series that I've ever experienced for the past decade (regardless of its different AniManga mediums from the LN, manga and the anime), and the masses would agree despite its stumbles along the way. So, before the anime series returns this Fall for its long-awaited Season 5, let's take a gander at this side project that he and illustrator Toshi Aoi have cooked for us, that is the bonding of Black Clover and Mashle: Magic and Muscles to become Wistoria: Wand and Sword, which started its serialisation after both series in December 2020.

If you're not one to get invested into its story and world-building too much, all you need to know is that the world of the series is essentially Mashle, with its Divine Visionaries plot being the full authority of its school to protect the peace in the land, and that its world is defined by magic and magic alone; nothing else could replace the system as it is. For if someone has the qualities of Mash Burnedead, who's all strength and no magic, or even Asta, who's got the bad luck of a five-clover magic sword that only imbues masses of evil, that person would be immediately singled out, chastised, tormented, and bullied for all their life. And said person is yet another of VA Kohei Amasaki's MC trifactor maestro mainstay for the Summer season, Will Serfort. His lack of magical aptitude (much like Mash and Asta) made him the butt of all jokes within the magic school that he attends: Rigarden Magical Academy, even going as far as his infamy around the academy for wielding not magic wands, but swords instead. The academy that pretty much functions like Mashle's Easton Magic Academy, serves to train, develop and harness future Divine Visionaries called Magia Vander to succeed those who've gone before them and continue that legacy of prior generations. And Will is one of the many in the myriad of its 6-year-generational students who hope to become the next Magia Vander, more so for the fact that one of his childhood friends, Elfaria Albis Serfort, is one such Divine Visionary for being the youngest Magia Vander who specialises in ice magic and created a dozen original spells that's unheard of, thereby labelling her as a prodigal musician and leading the Ice faction of said group. It's a cliche plot for crying out loud, but at least it's a unique and very good setting, if a touch too safe for its own good.

And what's the goal between the two childhood friends? Will must rise above the ranks to become a Magia Vander, all while Elfaria (or Elfie as nicknamed) just sits at her high throne in the Tower, doing nothing but slack as her responsibilities gets pushed to her subordinates, awaiting the day when she can be reunited together with Will as not just her foster brother, but of a very clear love interest. One thing's for sure, these two characters were certainly made for each other, like DanMachi's inseparable hero-deity-duo of Bell Cranel and goddess Hestia.

Alas, this is where I find most of my problems with the series: it's just stereotypical cliches and tropes done time and time again, that nothing is ever done to feel it being unique outside of the Shonen formula. At first, I thought that Fujino Omori, after gaining the experience to write a compelling MC like Bell Cranel, would do the same for Will Serfort, but it turns out that he, more than the inklings to Mash Burnedead, or more similarly with Asta for that matter, is just written like a stereotypical Shonen character, with nothing that truly makes him stand out other than his ""justice righteous"" character of note that his hard work precedes even the strongest magic. I was actually hoping that Will would have more of a brethren in comparison to Bell Cranel, but I was completely fooled at that thought as Fujino Omori didn't really leverage anything to show him as the underdog that while could defy expectations, just did not have a hint of personality (other than his awkwardness and strive under pressure that's just like Bell) that could get us to root for him, even in the worst of adversaries, while in his ultimate goal to ascend the Tower and reach Elfie, thus making them a bona-fide power couple. Will's just a flawed character, but a REALLY flawed character, who WILL throw hands if he needs to bring down the people who underestimated him.

And as if this offending easy mistake couldn't get any worse, just look at the supporting characters around him, which is just things that you CAN do in a Shonen series, but that you CANNOT remain the status quo in a Shonen series as well. Even series like Black Clover and Mashle had this recurring issue, but at least the sum of their problems isn't this egregious enough to cause a rift in the enjoyment factor of their series. You have the usual characters ranging from the usual love interest of classmate and close friend of Colette Loire who takes care of Will when everyone shuns him; to the various infighting of egoistical, one-dimensional ""villany"" students the likes of classmates Sion Ulster (specializing in fire magic), Julius Reinberg (specialising in ice magic, just like Elfaria), as well as Wignall Lindor (specialising in wind and illusion magic). I'd argue that Wignall at least has a character standout moment as someone like Will who is shunned by his elf dwarvens because of his weak magic, and he too mirrors his relationship with Elfaria with one of the fellow Magia Vander, so there's that. Even with the teacher professors that both recognised and hated Will's prowess to do the near impossible, they still see a potential to push him and oversee his progress in the magic amalgamation that is not just all about wands, but a lone sword as well that makes Will different from the rest. For sure, Will carries the series along its tug of plot devices in the big picture, and that act of justice and righteousness to accept ""the enemy of my enemies"" as they are, proves to the masses that Will Serfort is someone not to be underestimated nor trifled with, using the Power of Friendship to rally his cause forward, just like any other Shonen series.

I'd always see the day when the known adage of ""animation carries the show"" will come to strike many Shonen series that has come and gone, the likes of Jujutsu Kaisen, and Wistoria has done this trope, but to perfection. And you can thank the person who made all of this possible: Tatsuya Yoshihara. The director now famous for his work on Black Clover, he's the reason why this show works in the production department, with slick animation and bombastic Sakuga to boot, even if he hard carries the show both in its directorial input and series composition with his staff team, with the collab between Bandai Namco Pictures alongside one of the many subsidiary studios of Actas. And it wouldn't be a mistake to say that Wistoria definitely needed someone the likes of Tatsuya Yoshihara to even out the playing field with what J.C.Staff has been doing for DanMachi for years now, and what can I say? It's great and shows how the famed director has come thus far since his days directing Black Clover.

If you need a music composer who can execute the Shonen feels, look no further than Yuki Hayashi. The music composer famous for his work on Boku no Hero Academia a.k.a My Hero Academia's OST, and a fair few others the likes of Haikyuu!! to Gundam Build Fighters, he's your go-to when it comes to understanding what makes a Shonen series stand out regardless of their content, and he did Wistoria justice with a captivating OST that just feels oh-so-similar to Black Clover. I have nothing but the biggest praise for Yuki Hayashi, because like animation, music also does help provide the atmosphere for the series they are stemmed upon, and he just nailed the anime like he so does with prior series and franchises under his belt. But what I can't say aptly is the choice of the OP/ED songs. Penguin Research's OP song is just typical Shonen standard fare, and is honestly quite forgettable, as much as TRUE's ED is alright but nothing noteworthy.

In the end, I find myself conflicted at what Tsue to Tsurugi no Wistoria a.k.a Wistoria: Wand and Sword want to achieve being part of the now oversaturated Shonen AniManga playing field. On the one hand, while its animation prowess cannot be denied, everything else is just cookie-cutter standard Shonen things that you've seen time and time again. And honestly, IMO, it just gets boring of new seasonal shows doing the same-in, same-out, and Wistoria is one of the many shows bucking the trend that it ends up being the victim of its own success.

It's either for you if you're the type to like stereotypical Shonen shows, or it's just not for you if the standard Shonen trope isn't to your tastes."
58059,538865.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Have you ever imagined what Black Clover with consistently good animation would be like? Well, look no further. Wistoria:Sword and Magic is unapologetically inspired by the popular Jump series and Oomori’s other work Danmachi. It’s an underdog story featuring a protagonist who has all the odds stacked against him and finds a way to persevere, refusing to settle or compromise on his ambitions. Everyone loves a good underdog story and this is one of the best ones you’ll see. If you liked the idea of Black Clover, but maybe couldn’t get into Asta screaming so much at the start or the God awful production valuesfrom Pierrot for most of the season, Wistoria is a great option. Conversely, if like me you loved Black Clover and Danmachi and just want more of both of those worlds mixed together with great characters and amazing fights, this is the way to go.

Wistoria’s episode 1 is hands down one of the best episodes of anime I’ve ever seen. Directed by Yoshihara Tatsuya who worked on you guessed it, Black Clover, it is truly a feast for the eyes and a visual spectacle that perfectly sets up the magic and wonder of this world and makes you want more. Wistoria takes place in a world where magic is everything and those without it are looked down upon. Will’s journey to follow after his childhood friend and ascend the tower as a magia vander is compelling and you can’t help but root for him in the face of all the discrimination he endures. As usual in these sorts of shows, the MC gets bullied at the start and then ends up saving everyone who doubted him’s asses and that trope will never get old to me. The idea that people treat you poorly and look down on you just for being different and then next thing you know, they need your help. Will and other MC’s are better than I because I’d have left all of them to die in those dungeons, but I digress. Will is an incredibly kind person, at times to his detriment but he’s faithful to his values and determined to get to his friend’s side at the top of the magical world. 

There’s the obvious Black Clover and Danmachi shades, but Wistoria also has a lot in common with another of my faves, Nanatsuma or reign of the seven Spellblades. Taking place in a magical school with a dungeon underneath where students often go to explore and push themselves, underdog MC, emphasis on the importance of teamwork, etc. When watching this I couldn’t help but wonder how Nanatsuma would’ve faired with this sort of animation quality. The studio really did bring this magical world alive and make you want to know more and more about it each week. 

A big part of the appeal of this show is how good the animation is and it really is great. the action scenes all have film quality, they’re fluid, weighty and convey the sheer scale of power that’s used in this world. Episodes 1, 5 and 11 being my favourites with 11 being on par with 1 if not surpassing it thanks to the incredible OST. The standard art and designs of the show also look great though. Even when characters are just hanging out and doing mundane stuff it feels like you’re watching a movie. Staff did an incredible job here and I can’t wait for the second season. 

Wistoria’s not the most original story, like I said it’s got shades of a few existing shows, but it frankly looks and handles a lot better than them which gives it an advantage. Let’s face it. This is ANIME, so animation quality is just as important as storytelling in this medium. Artistically, this is one of the best shows of the year and pushes the envelope on what we can expect from seasonal adaptations. Even with that though, I like the story as well, generic as it may be. Will, Colette, Sion and the others grew on me a lot as the season went on and by the end I found myself desperately wanting to know more about the antagonists and who was behind certain events in the show. It’s definitely got a lot of story left to tell and I’m looking forward to season 2!

Wistoria gets 9 wands out of 10."
58059,539016.0,5.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Right off the bat: Animation – 10/10 (guys, just teach me how to use Maya like that, damn...) Music – 6/10 (well, it's not bad) Story – 2/10 (very typical but if that was the case I would've given it a 4 or 5; however, in this case it pretends to be super serious and becomes pure cringe) Overall – 5/10 Ok, so the MC, Will. Will, will Will will Will Will's will? Anyway... Kind of like the guy from Mashle but at least he has a positive IQ. But in exchange for his positive IQ he's a crybaby, and yet the strongest student physically. How does that work? Don'teven ask me, jeez. So he can defeat a freaking SS-rank monster (speaking in the MMO terminology) but can't give a good beating to some of his ""friends"" so that they stop fucking around with him. Why? Oh, that's because he's K__I__N__D. His heart is bigger that your M... Actually, no, nothing can compete with that, you're right.

The teachers at the academy are annoying af, but that's kind of realistic, I guess, at least for me, because in my country you can only be on good terms with your university teachers if you bribe them (or if you're female – do some ""pillow job"", so to speak). Thefore, respect for realism.

Every student around Will just seems to pay too much attention to him – if he's as useless as you claim, then why don't you just leave him alone? All his so-called ""friends"" are also very stereotypical: there's a guy who's all high-and-mighty because he thinks he's cool, there's another guy who's a hothead and always wants to fight with the MC (oh, god, that's why I don't like Shounen, bruh), then there's are girl who is in love with the MC and nobody knows why, let alone explains it somehow. And, finally there's his roommate who is indeed a REAL MAN, and together they could do some REAL MEN'S STUFF, but unfortunately the MC seems to be into girls. Oh, wowsers, zomg teh drama.

58059,538996.0,5.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"I'm not the type to absolutely hate something very often, but when I do, it's overrated garbage-heap anime that are generic but try to be different, but then do the exact same formula as all other basic reversed roles action fantasy anime. ""Wistoria: Wand and Sword"" is mainly bad since it had potential, some of the best anime are ruined by their unrealized potential by the original Manga/Light-Novel authors or by the main director of the anime adaptation. I'll be honest, I never read the manga for this anime, and I hope that the manga is different from this anime, since this has immense potential thatI never seen fully utilized.

I will start with the good:
1. Great Animation and Fight Scenes:
The animation is, without a doubt, superb. Whether it's the dynamic fight sequences or the meticulous detail of each setting, the art does an excellent job of setting the mood and immersing the viewer. I have to commend the team for this—it’s visually engaging and fluid, especially during the battles.

And... well, that’s where the praise ends.

1. Cliches, Tropes, and Generic Personalities:
Wistoria feels like a mishmash of every overused shounen fantasy trope thrown into a blender, and the result is something that’s both unoriginal and frustrating. This is like a smoothie, but you put in a bunch of weird ingredients to try and be different, and one of those ingredients spoils the entire drink and ruins the enjoyment from it's consumption. In essence, this means that this is just an MC that's just shoved into another environment to just be different, not to make an interesting story. 
Lets think this over first eh? The MC is a sword-fighter who dreams of becoming a wizard, but he’s completely inept at magic. So why is he enrolled in a magic academy that emphasizes magical combat? It makes no sense. His teachers acknowledge that while he’s intelligent, he’s not suited for battle magic. They even suggest he’d excel as a theoretical mage, focusing on research or writing instead of combat.
To put it in simpler terms: it’s like a high school teacher who’s great at explaining physics but can’t conduct groundbreaking experiments themselves. They might be excellent at teaching concepts, but that doesn’t mean they should be competing with top-tier physicists on actual experiments.
The problem here is that the MC’s situation feels contrived and lazy. He doesn’t really evolve as a mage; he remains primarily a sword-fighter throughout. So why is he at a magic school rather than a school for swordsmanship?

2. Horribly Generic Characters:
The characters are just as lackluster. The protagonist, your typical “poor-but-kind” underdog, gets bullied because of his lack of magical prowess but somehow scrapes by due to his sword skills (plot armor, anyone?). He’s essentially a stock “different but special” character we've seen many times before. His struggles don’t add depth; they just feel like a rehash of familiar tropes.
Then we have the school’s antagonists, a parade of copy-paste arrogant mages who look down on non-magical people. Their disdain is so over-the-top that they feel less like characters and more like caricatures. It’s lazy writing that manufactures cheap melodrama instead of creating compelling conflict. These antagonists are insufferable not because of clever writing, but because they’re predictable and one-dimensional.

3. Could've Been Better:
This critique applies mostly to the characters. They all come off as one-dimensional and lack the depth needed to make them truly engaging. Are they the worst I’ve ever seen? No, not by a long shot. But the characters, much like the rest of the show, feel limited and underdeveloped. Because of this, I can’t recommend Wistoria to the average viewer—there are simply too many better shows out there that offer more in every category.

5/10, Wish it was better.

58059,538994.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"I truly don't understand all the praise that's coming this show's way. There's no way anyone who watched past the 3rd episode would give this anything above a 5. It's so very average that it can only really qualify as kind of entertaining. I guess. Will is a pretty standard good hearted shonen protagonist. The only defining qualities that he really has is that he's really submissive and pretty pathetic. His character doesn't do much development over the course of the show aside from some moments where he gets a little angy. He's just this kind of effeminate, floaty, and kind kid who serves asan underdog the whole show. His motivation is pretty weak as well, it seems to just be that he's in love with the ice girl (I don't remember her name) and that he wants to stand beside her, which is pretty plain to me. He also is just this kind of tank in the show, where magic attacks don't really have much effect on him besides scratching him and making his mouth bleed for some reason. He can also Break through metal and ice pretty easily. They never really give a good reason for his tankiness, which makes for some pretty eye-roll moments during many of the fights where magic attacks basically just bounce off him or go right through him. The other characters are pretty much copy pasted from other magic school battle shonen. You have the hot headed bully that secretly respects the mc, the airheaded, but genius/super powerful love interest, the secretly gay, but popular friend, and the powerful mages that just smile all the time because of their confidence in their ability. Show unfolds in a pretty predictable manner in which will proves himself through various battles in front of his classmates, but the pacing isn't bad. What really disappointed me was the drop off in animation from the first couple of episodes. It started off with this beautiful animation, stuff on par with black clover and takt op destiny, and then it drops down to basically average animation. That was the main draw of this show for me because the art looked amazing at first. Overall just an average shonen, entertaining, but nothing of substance here really."
58059,539592.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"This was the best anime of the season. Who would have thought that a plot that initially seemed so generic would surprise us so quickly? I started paying more attention to the animation, and every detail is incredible. We have long sequences with a perfect transition from one shot to the next. The continuation of the same angle in the middle of a scene change during a battle is impressive. Small details that, if you pay close attention, leave you completely speechless. A LOT of passion was put into this adaptation. The soundtrack is also a standout, making tense moments even more intense—perfect in everyaspect.

Will doesn't just win through brute strength, and he's not just a talented swordsman. Will wins with intelligence; he studies, prepares, analyzes his opponent, and in the middle of a fight, he's able to do this in milliseconds thanks to his instincts. It’s incredibly satisfying when things that seem unrelated come together throughout the story.

The characters are captivating, and the animation is flawless. My congratulations to the studio and the entire team for the result. There’s still much to be revealed so we can better understand some points of the story, especially about the tower and the ""Magia Vander.""

The problem is that the underdog must be someone who isn’t really expected to be good and/or his abilities are unknown.Here we have an honorary student in a school of magic who can’t use magic, so logically he is so good he can make up for it in other disciplines, right? Also he goes solo into dungeons, so one more sign of him obviously not being underpowered or “abilities unknown”. And yet he is bullied by people for being erm… better than them? Oh, sorry, “not being able to use magic”. Don’t worry tho, cause we also have a 10/10 waifu who is in the highest position possible in that world but can’t just bring her boyfriend with her, we have a 9/10 side waifu who has no chances but doesn’t stop following our MC, we even have a rival who bullied MC cause he wanted MC’s respect. So yes, our “underdog” is, in fact, a usual all mighty OP MC 
Visuals/music. Will not argue, the show looks nice, if you just stop thinking about how typical the fights go (enemies show off their fireworks, make a surprised face and get defeated) - it is surely nice. The problem is that all those efforts were used on an underwhelming source. The music on the other hand - I can’t even recall if it was there.

Conclusion: I watched this whole thing without feeling any thrill or being entertained once and the reason is simple: I have seen everything this show has to offer a number of times, and many of those times were much, MUCH better. It doesn’t try to be original, it doesn’t try to be a good copy, it just uses the most simple and lazy tropes and calls it a day. This show has nothing but good visuals to offer."
58059,539113.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Danmachi (Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?) done right.😎 The story is about a Sword yearning to become a Wand. Our hero Will is brawn plus brain on steroids. He lacks magic skills and he uses his gifted speed, wit and strength to overcome obstacles to meet his beloved childhood sweetheart Elfie. Pros: 1) Nice story build-up. 2) BGM music is awesome. 3) Characters all well drawn and each character has some background story. 4) In just 12 episodes they told a lot about Wistoria world and various factions involved in determining that magical world's fate.Cons:
1) Slow in the beginning 
2) Could've shown more about the world or its history (like the Dwarves vs Magicians battle)


Anyways, the first season ended on a cliffhanger showing us some glimpses about other greater powers on both good and dark sides.🗿

All in all, solid anime that I recommend everyone to watch.👌🏻👍🏻"
58059,539369.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"As an enjoyer of fantasy and isekai-adjacent, power-fantasy anime, the premise and themes of this anime suit me very well. I also find the lore and setting intriguing, and the art, character design (and at times, the animation) to be very appealing. These positives are what allowed me to sit through this anime despite its god-awful characters and writing. I suspect that the poor quality in this regard can be traced back to the original manga writer, which probably means that future seasons (which seem to have been confirmed) will struggle to improve. All this is to say that I wouldn't recommend watching this anime asit stands, but if a director or writer manages to salvage the characters and writing in upcoming seasons, it might actually be worth watching, as I do feel that the studio, setting, and story hold some promise."
58059,538953.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"There is something to be said about an anime that isn’t particularly original, but does everything is so well that it really doesn’t matter anyway. Such is the case with this one. A story much like Mashle or many of the other similar ideas that are becoming popular today. This particular one does focus more on the drama and overcoming the odds in a more dramatic way, instead of focusing on the comedy. This gives it that iconic anime underdog feeling on this one, without ever feeling too much like the competition. What this has better than most is the animation quality. There is nounderselling that this has some of the best animation of the season. Even during the down moments, this show has better animation quality than most. It looks fantastic. I can see for some viewers the hyper movement in the action sequences can become a bit of a blur, but it does add to the action sequences for me making them look extremely fluid and interesting. 

Overall, I am so happy to hear that this one is getting another season. I have enjoyed this one pretty well from the start. If you are looking for some of the best action you will find this season, look no further.

Also shout out to this being my 200th completed anime on here, and what a fantastic way to round out that number."
58059,538919.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Not every show you watch has to be a masterpiece. Sometimes you don't want to be challenged, and you instead want to watch something completely predictable and unchallenging, where every story beat is as familiar and well trodden as your journey home. You've had a long day, and so you want to relax and just have some easy entertainment. This is what this show is. You watch this show because it has well animated and choreographed fights, because it won't let you down in delivering on bullies getting their recompense, the underdog getting their victory and prejudice being defeated. If you really value likeable and interesting characters, awell fleshed out world with a robust power system, an intriguing story or even a bit of nuance, then unfortunately this show just isn't for you.

The characters are generic and shallow, Will (the protagonist) is just a nice person, which is great and all but that's it. Generally speaking, the male characters all hate Will and bully him to the point of parody. At some point Will will prove himself to them and they will to various degrees accept him as a minor act of redemption, which I assume is an attempt of nuance. The main female characters of this show love Will. They didn't fall in love with him, it was merely assumed from the beginning. This is because they (like us the intelligent viewer) know that Will, despite being seen as completely worthless by the very specific standard his society values, is in fact very powerful and brave and cool and brave again. If (God forbid) you're a background character? Disposable fodder that the viewer doesn't need to feel bad about getting ruthlessly killed. You get the gist.

I mention the characters only because it was a limiting factor to my enjoyment even when I had done my best to turn my brain off. My eyes still rolled when characters went after Will at their own heavy detriment because actually they were only bullying Will because they felt ignored. However, with that said, characters are very important to me, and maybe they aren't for you. Maybe this is your first anime and the tropes don't annoy you as much.

To conclude, a bit of story, power systems and nuance aren't going to elevate what is inherently a popcorn show into anything more, so don't worry about it. Just sit down, vegetate out and enjoy some easy fun to give your brain some time to relax."
58059,538900.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"If you're a fan of of the style of older 2000s anime but with modern up to date animation, this is the anime for you. Wistoria Wand and Sword is your typical classical shounen story with all the stereotypes and gimmicks that come with it. It has the fun art style of the past with colorful fun hairstyles (cute alfalfa included) while having a clean style where the animation never falters. No basic lip flapping, everything is whooshing and fluid and just full of personality. If not a little over the top when it comes to our protagonist's rivals and antagonists-- because this show loves goingham when it comes to expressions filled with malice and anger.

The story is that of an underdog trying to prove themselves time and time again, even when unintentionally doing so for the sake of pride and accomplishment. In a world where magic is the supreme dominating factor while Will can do nothing but use a sword and any tools at his disposal, there's a lot going against him. A very uphill battle as he must show he is capable to students peers and professors alike. And he does so in very stunning flashy ways. The fluid animation and flashy colors does a lot of the heavy lifting to put greater impact on this story and it does so very well.

There's a hidden depth to this story not only in the dangerous tower and the fear of their false sky, but especially so in hints of the final episode. That there is so much more going on in the background we've yet to uncover. We've only seen the surface of this magic school and surface level past your everyday school shenanigans. 

The over the topness at the beginning might make you second guess this anime. A lot of what happens is predictable, but with enjoyable outcomes nonetheless as we see our protagonist grow and put himself out there. I highly recommend giving it a shot... and I'm super excited to see what's in store for season 2 after the little tidbits of plot we were given after the final episode!"
58059,539774.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"If you're looking for an anime to fill your O.P. magicless MC plate in a world full of magic, then Wistoria is the anime for you. To basically describe this anime ""It's a more serious Mashle, but instead of fists and creampuffs its swords and battle glasses. It is a nice watch for these reasons: 1. The storytelling and setting This anime's character storytelling is insane, as not only do we have a somewhat fleshed-out backstory and reasons for why the magicless MC is at a magic academy and trying to reach his impossible goal. But, all the other side characters have their histories andreasons explored as well. Basically saying that this anime doesn't just leave you guessing why someone does or acts in that manner without providing a solid backstory. 

This anime has the setting of the oh-so-common magical academy (like Reign of the Seven Spellblades), especially when it comes to focusing on the mega dungeon/labyrinth right below the academy where the characters must enter and fight monsters to achieve their goals.

2. The animation
Wistoria has very solid animation throughout the entire season and does not seem to falter anywhere even in the high-impact action scenes. The spells look amazing and the sword fighting visuals are nothing to scoff up, especially when you know that the director of this anime was also the director of Black Clover. The character's expressions and body language also benefit from this good animation style.

3. The Trope and cliché
I will not lie, Wistoria does fall into the category of the MC with immense powers that isn't respected or is bullied due to those powers being different. It also has the classic supporting female classmate who receives no attention from the MC, as the MC only has eyes for one person (making it their goal to reach her). Hey there's also a tournament arc in the middle of this anime. However, if you do like an overpowered MC and these tropes then this anime will be a good watch for you.

Overall, I enjoyed Wistoria for the anime it was due to its amazing characters, animation and fight scenes throughout the entirety of it. It is a great adaption from its source material and is defiantly worth a watch."

Do watch it tho It Totally got my blood rushing. and YEA MHA FANS SEASON 1 of MHA WAS AS BLAND AS BRITISH FOOD. Probably its the Britishers who are Hardcore MHA fans. Overall rating 9/10- Watch it with your Brains Closed its the usual Cinderella Story. Watch it For its good Animation, Bland yet Good story , Great Action and Lastly Side Characters. Story 9/10- World Ruled by the Mighty and Strong. Boy with No Talent is Shunned byall .......... You know the rest He becomes strong and stuff. So yea No new story but the way it progresses is really good so i give it high points. The author captured how people around him will behave in a very true sense so Props to him for that.

MC 1/10 - Your daily Super Nice, Kind, Just , Hardworking and Most of all A P---ssy Mc. He is nothing special he is the character i dislike the most in this anime. TLDR Bro is a P--ssy Chaser he is chasing around A white Haired High ranking Magic Girl Who is also high childhood friend maybe his first love too Not sure tho whether he loves this white girl or no.

Side Chars 9/10 - They are great Some are Harsh and Bad Towards Mc but actually wishes good from him, Some are straight up nice to him and Some just use him but later repent, Some are Hardcore Haters of MC since the moment they were born While Some Truly Care and love him. Dont wanna give much on them. One of them (Red Hair) i find him as a complex character i really like that and the way the Author Has integrated him with the story and portrayed him i find it really really Interesting.

Character Development 7/10 - There is some Decent Character Development.

Music 10/10 - Music quality and Selecting of BGM is really good.

58059,539346.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"How to describe it, at first sight it's a ""Oh I'm a looser so i will train until I'm op"" but that's not the story that they are telling here! So sit in your chair and listen (read) to me carefully. Let's start with the emotional touch that this series has, we are presented a protagonist that has -1 affinity with magic in a world where your magic abilities define your status. But our protagonist it's a hard head boy that has a objective and he doesn't have anything but that in his head. So we have a fantasy world, centered around wizards with a""inept"" protagonist (to the eyes of the standards of that world). It's a story of resilience, with a goodheart and open-mind protagonist that will do anything to protect what matters to him. I enjoy it from beginning to end.

Animation: 9/10. It's not a masterpiece of art, but it will not let you down, it has fluid animation, with smooth movements in the fighting scenes. 
Drawing: 8.5/10. Solid drawing with good attention to detail and good use of the characteristics of the world.
Plot: 7.5/10. Solid plot, with a clear high arch moving along the small first season arch, i will think that they are going to keep these dynamics from now on. A little bit generic the construction of the world, it's not bad but i don't have anything to highlight from wold construction.
Characters: 6.5/10. Really solid main character but when we see the secondary ones... it's a little bit hollow, they develop though this first season but they start in a reaally simple mind first state.
Voice Acting (JP):  9/10. They get the point in the expression of the emotions. They characterizes they role as you would expect.

Final score: 8.1/10."

If it was so pleasing to just turn off your brain and watch, I would have drop but due to the points I shared before you can just watch without much issue. But if it was just a basic anime, it wouldn’t have had such a high rating and that because episode 9-12 has to be one of the best anime come back story I have every seen. If you have watch danmachi, from season 1-4, you mightunderstand what I’m coming from. This show was developed so much lore, depth, and actual steaks for the characters to losing in the last 3 episodes makes everything before it  worth it. 

If you can watch  the fast half of the show with no problem, and think the story is kinda boring, just please wait till episode 10, you’ll he anxiously waiting for season 2. If your the job that can’t watch more than 5 episodes, then your perfectly fine to skip this one. It’s good but it isn’t a anime you recommend to some who is still trying to get into anime. It more of a “do you have free time” between actual God like anime’s.

58059,539420.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Wistoria Wand and Sword Wistoria Wand and Sword is an okay spin on the magical school format which introduces some interesting and gorgeous animation but falls short of living up to it. Particularly the nature of how plot information is conveyed through constant repetition drags down the show a large amount. Depictions of women are unfortunate despite designs I would class as okay. For these reasons I would class it as a 6/10, above average but nothing special. To start with probably the best thing about Wistoria the animation at play here is stellar. The spellcasting effectively uses really nice and complex shading to give a greatfeel as well as lots of time and attention being given to objects created. The Elven wood summoning and fire magic are particular standouts to me but smaller things like Julius’ ice flowers also came out great. On the physical side the fight choreography for Will’s movement is extremely dynamic and like the elusive samurai which is also airing this season immensely aids in selling his character. The one notable sour spot is the backgrounds, especially in the final arc where the messy flesh texture is in my opinion poorly done and distracting. However throughout the show there are various points where the contrast between the amazing character art and relatively cheap backgrounds becomes distracting.

The character design is simple with fire mages having red hair, ice mages having blue hair and so on. It is very effective in blocking out the characters. This is aided significantly by the fun design used for the caped uniforms which I enjoyed watching flap around with the aforementioned very good animation budget. Female designs in particular benefit a lot from this largely avoiding male gazey big breasted low cut tops with the exception of elfie whose facial design I quite like but the rest of which I find very unfortunate.

Continuing with female agency in the show is very poor with every major female character of will’s age group present ending up living a life defined in relation to Will. Colette is never seen spending her time thinking about anything else with the same true for “Ms Perfect” Lihanna” Even the all powerful Magia Vender Elfie is seen clutching a pillow of will in the ED and frequent cuts to her all consist of her thinking about him. To cut them some slack on this it appears to be a general writing fault as this broadly applies to every character in the series however I don’t think this makes it much better. It would’ve helped the world building a lot if we were exposed to someone who didn’t spend all their time thinking about Will after first interaction.

Continuing from the characters, I found the writing for most of them to be oversimplified and a bit uninteresting. Characters are classed into an archetype and with 1 notable rapid exception never evolve or deviate from that. Sion probably has the best written development but the way they play him still gets very grating when you can see exactly what’s going on.

Possibly contributing to this was the series inability to not step on it’s own toes by repeating information. Using an example from the character writing the elf wignall’s backstory is first implied in a way that conveyed all necessary information to the audience. However it was then felt necessary to repeat that information multiple times dragging out the scene and making it feel shallow. This is an issue that extends to pretty much everything be it showing someone attacking wings and dealing no damage, having them say that only to cut to will in his head saying “I read in a book those wings don’t take damage”. Another example is when an important person shows up in the final episode and the group’s reactions clearly convey their opinions on him; however it is once again felt necessary to give a narration of the information. Both of these massively slow down the scene and remove the interest giving to the audience by having to piece together the already pretty spoonfed shown information.

The world building is so:so, it’s not a complete copy of fantasy tropes but it still finds itself pretty simple. The credits system is interesting but finds itself in a weird position as it becomes clear that the author intends to use it as a power scaling system. The magic system is nothing special and finds itself in the common midpoint between a clicky and defined system and my personal preference for the vague and awe inspiring undefined nature of the cosmos. The use of dwarves is pretty simple but I found it to be an effective way to convey the unfair and cruel state of the dominant society

As I said in the opener though I am critical of it I don’t hate Wistoria wand and sword, if it was some disgusting slop I would’ve dropped it at episode 4. It’s something that is firmly okay and I’m sure someone who has watched far less than me might even find it very enjoyable. But as it stands it’s got enough problems to chip away and it’s foundations and bring it down to a 6."
58059,539260.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Wistoria: Wand and Sword is an engrossing magical adventure story that takes place in a world where warriors and wizards coexist and compete for supremacy. The show centers on Will Serph, a regular boy without magical abilities living in a world where strong magic users rule. Despite lacking natural magical ability, he is determined to ascend to the top of the magical realm using a sword—an unusual weapon in a world where wands are the norm. The animation is really bright and insanely beautiful, with the action scenes standing out as fluid and intense. The magical spells, and character designs are visually appealing. With an engagingnarrative, the pacing strikes a balance between action and storytelling, enabling viewers to fully enjoy Will's journey.

The character development in Wistoria: Wand and Sword is one of my favorite aspects in the series. The plot is made more complex by Will's interactions with other characters, each of whom has special skills and motivations. Will's perseverance and personal development are at the heart of the narrative. The anime also addresses themes such as tenacity and the conflict between innovation and tradition; Will's use of a sword serves as a symbol of his defiance of social norms.

Even though Wistoria follows a formula that is common to many shounen anime, it offers enough unique elements to keep viewers interested—especially those who love underdog tales. Though the show occasionally falls back on genre clichés, the world-building could use more development as some aspects of the magical system are still unclear.

All things considered, Wistoria: Wand and Sword is such a thrilling journey brimming with magic, action, and heart. If you love Mashle and Black Clover, then this is the next series you should watch next!!"
58059,539386.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"The story is not new and for some people, it may feel so-so. But Wistoria's studio, Actas, has given its animation a superb treatment. It's an enjoyable watch. Synopsis: Our main character, Will Serfort, attends a magical school. He is a diligent student. He works hard to earn credits. His only problem is that he cannot wield magic, and this is why he is often bullied and called a 'flunker.' Much of the plot is about him getting disrespected, then he will fight him, and then he will gain their respect. That's it. This is not new. In some sense this is similar to Harry Potter orThe Worst Witch in that the protagonist is a so-so student. (But unlike in Harry Potter, he is a diligent student, squeezing as many credits as possible without magic.)

I have mixed feelings with respect to the main character. He may be relatable if you have low self-esteem, and his glory is overcoming his personal issues. But too often, he allows others to bully him. Good thing he is able to turn things around and prove himself worthy.

That said, it's a standard action anime with a number of sakuga moments that are worth watching. It's not as well made as The Elusive Samurai in terms of animation, but this is more suitable for teenagers compared to TES, which is more suitable for children. 

In conclusion, this is a well-made and enjoyable action anime even if it can be criticised as cliche."
52635,538922.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Tower of God deserves better than this. After a four years wait between season 1 and season 2, what we get is akin to a PowerPoint slide show rather than a proper anime adaptation of one of the most popular manhwa. ART STYLE: There is a noticeable difference in art style between seasons 1 and 2. In season 1, the art style was more unique and colorful and fits with the overall mysterious atmosphere of the tower. In comparison, the art style + color palette in this season is completely bland and generic, and the characters are often drawn off-model and look inconsistent. ANIMATION: Frankly, the animationis ass. This season is full of still shots and the animation completely lacks any fluidity. The fight scene in the first episode is the best in animation the season has to offer; afterwards, the animation for the rest of the season completely plummets. The punches and blasts completely lack any impact, the fighting choreographies are lazy, important techniques specifically named and emphasized in the manhwa are skipped, and most of the non-fighting animation are limited to either character mouth movements or character walking/running movements. The characters always look so stiff and lifeless, and even the characters walking or running look very awkwardly animated. There are minimal body or hand gesture movements, plus character expressions are also mostly static.

DIRECTING: This season is directed by someone who is a complete novice at directing, and it shows. Everything about the anime looks so cheap and uninspired, and in turn makes the entire show feel so soulless and bland. It's no exaggeration to say that a vast majority of the shots consist of either zoom-ins/face shots or characters just awkwardly standing around with zero creativity or thought put into the camera angles. The camera pans on the characters' eyes or faces so often that it's distracting and an obvious way of cutting corners. The transitions from scene to scene feel awkward and disjointed as well. Even the ""comedy"" scenes are not funny, any emotional scenes lack any impact, and the scenes that are obviously supposed to feel very hype and tense lack any suspense and intensity. It feels like the studio is adapting things by going through a checklist of what to adapt instead of actually putting effort and care into what they're adapting.

CHARACTERS: This season focuses on the introduction of a completely new cast of characters from the first season. While season 1 revolves around a cast of genius characters with above average strength, this season revolves more around a cast of normal/misfit characters with mostly average/below average strength. Yes, the main cast of characters from the first season make brief appearances and will eventually return, but this season is mostly a setup to the introduction of the new cast of characters and for the big battle arc next cour.
However, this season fails at making any of the new characters compelling. Their interactions as a team feel so forced and the characters are barely given any depth. Numerous character interactions were cut from the manhwa that make you care more about the characters and help to develop them to understand their personalities, views, and motivations for climbing up the tower. A lot of the dialogues that were cut were a baseline that build up to dialogues that were included in the anime, so some conversations the characters have in the anime feel so unnatural and out-of-nowhere.
It's especially hard to care for any of the characters when the way they are drawn and animated is so dull and lifeless. The VAs have to carry many of the scenes, since the anime, with the static character expressions and stiff animation, fails to properly convey the various emotions of the characters.

STORY: The storyboard writing and the way the anime presents the story is clunky. Many times, the events that occur in the episodes seem random, disconnected, and rushed through. Key information to understand the context of what's happening in the show, such as time skips or what floor the characters are on, are omitted for no reason.
The first four episodes of this season are especially painful to watch. The first big game/test arc of this season has horrible pacing, so much so that it's difficult to understand the game rules and care about anything that is going on. The anime even skipped out on properly explaining the conclusion of that arc, which was vital information and had no reason to be excluded.
The remaining episodes have slightly better pacing; however, everything else - the directing, the storyboard writing, the animation, etc. - continue to be subpar, thus failing to create a fluid, cohesive story and failing to make the developments in the story feel exciting.

MUSIC: Kevin Penkin's music carries the show. He never misses when it comes to creating a playlist of epic soundtracks. However, the placements of the OSTs in some scenes are questionable, and it sometimes feels as if the OSTs are randomly thrown in everywhere to make up for everything else the anime lacks.
The OP is visually presented like a scrapbook, while the ED shows 1-3 snapshots of each episode. The studio really seems to be doing all they can to cut corners when even the OP and ED have little to no animation.

Ultimately, S2 is a huge disappointment. This season is barely watchable. I can't recommend it when the source material is clearly not being respected and the anime doesn't offer anything above mediocrity in any aspect, aside from the OSTs. You're way better off reading the manhwa while playing the OSTs in the background."
52635,538918.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Oh how the mighty have fallen. What was once one of the most hyped anime of all time, Tower of God is a shadow of its former self. Changing studios completely destroyed the quality of this show. Horrible animation, art and fights that look like my nephew put them together in MS paint.. not even a Kevin Penkin masterclass could save this. Barring some miracle in the second cour, this will go down as one of the biggest collapses ever and that’s not hyperbolic. Funny enough, ToG season 2’s story is actually better than season 1’s by quite a bit. We meet a lot of newcharacters and the world gets expanded substantially introducing new factions, allies and foes. The tower which we already know is almost incomprehensibly massive, gets explored in a way we didn’t see in season 1. Bam’s whole edgy FUG Viole phase was actually pretty cool too. But, it’s overshadowed by the horrible pacing, direction, animation and art of this season. I always say that anime is a two part story. Yes, a good plot and narrative are important,  but it is ANIME at the end of the day, so If that narrative is wrapped in horrible production quality it’s going to hurt it. Occasionally during this cour, we did have a good episode where the animation was passable and that was great.. but, it just didn’t happen nearly enough to save this season. 

Pacing even as an anime only notably feels off. I’ve heard from manwha readers that they often skipped chapters or adapted too many in one go, and it shows. It feels at times that things are happening too fast and you just feel lost when watching. I think it did get better in the last 3-4 episodes when some big twists have, but you shouldn’t have to wait two months for a show to get its act together. 

For me, the only thing I really enjoyed in this season was the worldbuilding. Season 1 felt kind of claustrophobic because we were with Bam, Khun and the group on a select few floors as they were beginning this long and arduous journey to the top. Season 2 really shows you the sheer scale of the tower, reveals more of the powers that be in this world, terrorist organisations trying to change the world order. It’s almost like a child realising how insignificant they are in the vastness of an ocean. Say what you will about Tower of God, but this author knows how to world build. I mean there’s enough stuff here that ToG could go on easily past One Piece in terms of length. Just needs a better team behind it. Bam’s character arc was actually really good in this though. Did enjoy seeing him go from the wimp in season 1 to this Edgelord Chad here, BUT the fact he’s still simping for Rachel annoys the hell out of me.

Whether or not you’ll enjoy season 2 of ToG really depends on how big a fan you are of the series. I think manhwa readers who have been on the series for years and are looking forward to some of their fave moments being adapted will be disappointed overall, but find some solace in some of the hype moments. Anime onlies will be in shock from the drop of quality from season 1 and feel lost for half the season. In short, Season 2 of Tower of God is a better story, worse anime. What you choose to do with that info is up to you.

Tower of God gets 6, out of 10."
52635,539111.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"First of all, this season is completely different from the first one. In the beginning you might even think you have the wrong anime... This time, we don't have a ""Main Character"" anymore - our MC from season 1 is totally different, the story is hardly told by his point of view, and instead we have a ton of new characters being pushed into the story in a confusing way. In fact, we have so many new characters that we don't have enough time to connect to them emotionally, which takes away the enjoyment of watching this anime. The animation quality also dropped a lot, even inthe action scenes. What pains me the most is the new character design for the MC, always hiding his eyes, and with the low quality animation it just seems like they got lazy drawing him.

The character development didn't go well because we have too many characters and different stories all squeezed into 13 episodes, so it was sloppy.

The plot was definitely the one that suffered the most in this season, since with all the different characters and the sloppy attempt to tell their stories, we got almost no progress to the plots that we were expecting from Season 1.

It's not bad but they are building ground for the third season so as transition season I recommend seen it where start the emission of the third one, so you have everything fresh (This thinking that the next season will be intense). Considering all of this I still recommend the season, they put in the table new things, as the conditions of the relation between baam and FUG. Animation: 6/10. It feels, specially in the fighting scenes a little bit rigid, the movements lack of fluidity. Drawing: 6/10. It's alittle too flat, it doesn't glow but its ok.

52635,539708.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"It's astonishing how much the second season has degraded compared to the first. The animation is terrible. They use static images to create movement, insert backgrounds or wide shots just to stretch the runtime, and avoid animating characters. The characters' faces are completely stiff and emotionless. The fight scenes are dull and overly simplistic, lacking any choreography or detail. Most of the fights are just one character winding up for a hit, followed by the impact in the next frame. It’s incredibly lazy. The direction and production are really poor. In the previous season, the choir music was fantastic and atmospheric—I still remember it, and it dida great job of enhancing the mood. In this season, the music is bland at best, and sometimes even annoying.

It's such a shame that this season was handed over to The Answer Studio. The show feels indifferent, cheap, and tasteless. To me, even a 15-year-old show like Fairy Tail, which was made cheaply and simply with daily episodes (leading to quality issues), is far better produced than this season of Tower of God."

There were some scenes which were inconsistent and some episodes which were disappointing outright. Story - they edited out some of the good parts Animation - 7 (because the animation was awesome but there were drops in quality in someparts )

Overall i am still going to continue watching this out of respect to the Mahwah but i am disappointed in the presentation of a story that could have rivaled onepiece"
52635,539502.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"No greater sin can be made by a work of art than to simply be mediocre. Great works get remembered for the feelings they leave you with, and bad ones are remembered in hideous laughter, but when you slip into the realm of mediocrity, you quickly find your own identity wither away. That's the story of the second season of Tower of God. Tower of God, Season 2 is a testament to what happens when you're doing work that's clock in and clock out. Directed by the same person who's done key animation work for fantastic works like Your Name and Akira, among others, you wouldthink that some of that creativity and love for the medium would carry over when direction work under your own wing. Naturally, you could not be more wrong.

One of the biggest, and the most obvious downgrades from the previous season is undoubtedly the animation. It's hard to miss, after all. The pencil-like, roughly drawn, almost coarse animation style of season 1 of ToG gave it a certain sort of a washy feeling where the characters moved much like the Shinsu itself. It made complete sense. The art drawn was flowy like the power system that it was complimenting. It was pleasing to look at, and even though it wasn't bombastic with any of the fight scenes, the sheer ""vibe"" that it was giving off, more than made up for its shortcomings. 

And then you look at season two. The entire staff showed up for work, did the work that the producer requested, and went back home. Nothing more, nothing less. Passionless, bloodless, run of the mill ""isekai of the season"" tier of animation. 

Maybe it's just me, but when you make art, what's the end goal? To produce the lowest of any denominator, a milquetoast corporate product? Or is it to make things that make an impression on people? Something that resonates with them, urging them forward, to make something unique of their own, so that further generations always have something beautiful to look upon? The director of ToG s2 would seem to disagree. 

I'm aware of the lack of popularity in for this series in the Japanese space. It's a small miracle in itself that the first season even managed to penetrate its' niche. There's little doubt in my mind that this season didn't have the funding needed to procure anything beyond the first season. That's okay, that's how these things go. But this isn't that. This is not ""we tried our best with what we had"", and you know it.

Continuing with not trying their best. I called the animation ""one of the biggest downgrades"", yet I do not believe it is the biggest one. The greatest sin here, in my mind, is by far the direction itself. From the scenes shifting randomly in incomprehensible ways that are near impossible to follow, to illogical  fights that look like my 10 year old self mashing two toy soldiers together and spitting out *crash* and *boom* sounds. And that's not even the worst example. The most gruesome crime here is what they did to Kevin Penkin's soundtrack. Mind you, the very same soundtrack that won OST of the year, a few years back. Now reduced to 3-4 second soundbites, placed in random locations. Many of the songs don't even have any build up, some of them make no sense. Some of the best songs don't even play at all, and whatever new music that is introduced, had completely inane editing decisions. All around the sound department for this anime is atrocious, and I don't see anyone else mentioning the disgrace that was done to original composer.

All in all, this is the most ""whelming"" season of an anime. There's nothing special, there's nothing unique, some of the VFX of the shinsu looks fairly decent, especially in episode one, but other than that, there's no love to be found here.

And as a certain someone once said - without love, it cannot be seen.

Thanks for reading."
52635,539054.0,5.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Alright, let’s just get this over with. Season 2 picks up a few years after the events of the first. The 25th Bam, now going by the ominous name Jue Viole Grace, is part of FUG, a shady organization bent on overthrowing the mighty Jahad (yes, with a J). For Viole, though, it’s less of a choice and more of a forced, love-hate relationship with FUG. Even after being alone since the first floor, he’s back to working with - and against - people he can’t help but grow attached to. Now that the intro’s out of the way, let’s get into the details, shall we? I’mgoing to try to capture the overall feeling of this season, since that’s what made season 1 so great - not the visuals, not the music, not even the story, but the feeling of it all coming together. Me? Oh, I absolutely binged the living hell out of the first season. 

Right, right, I’m getting to it... Okay?! Just give me a second here.

So, the overall feeling of Tower of God Season 2 is... well, underwhelming. And that’s putting it kindly. The most immediate and obvious difference? The artwork. Whether you liked or disliked the art style of the first season, you can’t deny that it had a distinct look. The colors were vibrant, the animation was smooth, and you could feel the care that went into every scene. Fast forward to Season 2, and all of that is gone. The aesthetic feels generic. Bland. But here’s the kicker: the animation is lazy. Like, really lazy. The special effects are so poorly done that they make my childhood doodles seem like art in comparison. From start to finish, the visuals lack any kind of flourish, leaving us with a show that feels flat and lifeless.

The music? Still good, but it feels recycled. There are no standout new tracks, and somehow, even the familiar ones don’t hit as hard. In fact, I’d argue it’s worse than season 1. The audio effects that enhanced the music back then are gone. This just makes the contrast between the decent soundtrack and the subpar visuals all the more jarring. It’s like watching Beauty and the Beast, except the Beast never gets his redemption arc.

And that brings me to the story. Oh boy, the story. Let’s get one thing straight: I understand that adapting a sprawling narrative like Tower of God means making some cuts. There’s simply too much content to fit into a single season, so naturally, some elements have to be dropped. But that’s not the real issue here. A lot of unnecessary scenes were included, while crucial moments that could have enriched character development were left behind. Instead of focusing on the growth of our characters, we’re treated to drawn-out dialogue that often explains things we can easily deduce just by watching the action unfold. Remember the golden rule of storytelling: “show, don’t tell”? Well, it feels like the creators of Season 2 completely forgot that, and the result is a story that trips over itself instead of pulling you in. In the end, this leads to a pacing that slows everything down.

Honestly, there’s no real saving grace for season 2. The majority of it is mediocre at best, and the parts that are bad are really bad. The plot lacks any real tension, and the visual downgrade is impossible to ignore. Everything about this season feels like it was phoned in, like the new studio didn’t have the time, energy, or budget to deliver the same level of quality we got in the first season.

After sitting through the whole thing, I can’t help but feel like we’ve been flat-out scammed. Seriously, what happened here? season 1 gave us hope - it teased us with the idea that Tower of God could be something truly epic, something special. And then season 2 comes along and just yanks the rug out from under us, like a cruel joke. We waited for this? What we’re left with isn’t just a disappointment - it’s a slap in the face. A bland, lifeless sequel that barely even tries. How did they manage to take all that potential and flush it down the drain? It’s generic. It’s uninspired. And if this is the direction the series is headed in, I’m telling you right now: don’t even bother. Why waste your time on something that’s clearly lost the spark that made it great in the first place? Honestly, if this is what they’re serving up, I’m done.

In conclusion: disappointing, forgettable, and thoroughly generic. Here’s hoping the new studio gets their act together, but I’m not holding my breath."
52635,539103.0,3.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"First off, I just learned that this season IS not over, it continues Oct 6th, so I will keep this brief. This season is a departure completely, from the animation to the story, to the characters. It is all bad. Every aspect of this anime is done poorly. One look at the history of this studio and things become clear. I have little hope for episode 14-26. The story is so disjointed and splattered with nonsense. I think this will be the last season of Tower of God that I watch. Animation 6/10 - S1 wasn't peak animation, butit was sharp, defined, and looked good at times.  This season just doesn't.  The fighting is god awful to boot.
Sound 6/10
-  It exists, but there is nothing special going on here.
Story 3/10
-  Bad, just bad.  This is ADHD ridden story telling.
Characters 1/10
-  What happened to this anime?  Bam is intolerable.  Oh sorry, Bam the 25th lol...Every character is garbage, it's insane how bad this anime went from S1 to S2.
Enjoyment 3/10
-  I might have enjoyed 10 minutes of the 13 episodes.  Only reason I kept watching is to watch it with my bro, who has more optimism for this garbage.

I cannot recommend this dumpster fire.  After season 1, I had no idea Vinland Saga S2 would have competition for trashiest second season of all time."
52635,539652.0,3.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"I can’t say I was ever the biggest fan of the first outing of the Tower of God adaptation, but it had a lot of stuff worth sticking around for, and I was really rooting for its potential sequel seasons to be great. However, much like a large portion of this show's audience, I’m severely disappointed by how this turned out in the end. While I don’t believe that the change of studio is the only culprit of the drop in quality of this show, it certainly is the elephant in the room. What once was a visually unique show with a captivating atmosphere thatmanaged to capture both the grandeur and the mystique of the setting, has turned into a generic and frustratingly cheap-looking adaptation that undoes all the work previously provided by its predecessor. The quality is, quite frankly, absolutely abysmal, and I can’t think of a single shot or action in these 13 episodes that satisfied me in any sort of way. Stiff, emotionless, and uninspired, are just some of the words I’d use to describe the presentation of this season.

But almost more importantly, I feel the actual content of this part of the story doesn’t really hit the mark as well. The majority of the characters that we knew are almost entirely absent in this season, replaced by a new, dull cast of characters that match the quality of the animation to a tee. I sure hope I’m not the only one finding these designs impossible to take seriously, because everyone looks so unfathomably stupid, no matter what they’re doing. Furthermore, you absolutely CAN NOT introduce this many characters at once and expect us to care about them. What you actually do is you drip-feed the audience with new characters, so that their personality and place in the story is well established before more start being introduced.

I also find it very difficult to recall just about anything that transpired during this season. I feel like nothing happened, all while everything (including the characters, status quo, etc…) changed between the two entries of the show. It’s such a weird way to tell a story and I do not jibe with it one bit. I cannot for the life of me see how the source material got as big as it did if this is how the rest of it is gonna go. I really do think this is a textbook example of “a more complicated story does not equal a better one”. I would’ve been perfectly content with following the previous seasons’ main group of characters for the majority of the story, but instead, it just had to go ahead and try to prove something that, in the end, it just couldn’t. A show like this should slowly build upon its relatively simple foundation, not throw it out the window as a sad excuse for a “hook” and have to start over from a much, much less compelling beginning. I get that maybe this'll come full circle in future installments of the Tower of God adaptation, and the previous characters become relevant again. But I haven't read the source material, and evaluating this as a single season leaves much to be desired. 

Music’s still great though."

If anyone thought i would be interested in some boring and shallow characters i care nothing about then the certain individual would probably need to attend some MRI evaluation.

Also the animation degraded on few levels - on some occasions i almost felt like watching Seanzoz's ""The Senile Scribbles"" parody thing on youtube (and i don't mean the mentioned yt series is bad, it's just different style of animation and it fits the ""parody"" quite well). TBHthe ONLY insteresting thing in whole season was the intro clip &amp; music (and i'm the guy who usually skips that bs). I cannot force myself to recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the first season and just wanted to see continuation of that story (that one thrid of one episode does not really count, i bet it's sole purpose was to install a hook for next season)."
52635,539164.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Tower of God: Season 2 – Return of the Prince brings back the complex world of the Tower with an engaging blend of intrigue, new character dynamics, and a sense of looming danger. This season picks up 6 years after the explosive events of season one, and it continues to build on the intricate world and character dynamics that fans have come to expect. While this season introduces new faces, reveals unexpected alliances, and showcases growing tensions, it also has a few pacing issues, especially for fans familiar with the original Manhwa. Still, it manages to deliver a compelling narrative, leading into what promises tobe one of the series' most exciting arcs: the Workshop Battle.

Plot (8/10):
The story this season may feel disjointed at times, particularly to fans of the source material, but it remains a strong narrative arc. Return of the Prince serves primarily as a setup for the highly anticipated Workshop Battle, one of the most thrilling arcs in the series. FUG’s manipulation of Baam by holding his former team hostage adds a lot of tension, especially because Baam, still unaware of how much his friends have grown, finds himself at their mercy. Rachel continues to deepen her role as a cunning antagonist, her manipulative journey to the Workshop adding layers of hatred and frustration toward her character.

Characters (8/10):
The introduction of new characters in this season is handled well, with each one bringing distinct and memorable personalities to the table. The diversity of their traits and interactions makes for a lively and engaging cast. The bond between the characters has deepened, reflecting the amount of time they’ve spent together during their ascent of the Tower, even if some interactions are left in the background. Khun’s scheming in the shadows, motivated by his desire to avenge his fallen friends, was a high point of the season, adding emotional depth to his character.

Animation (8/10):
Though the animation quality took a step back compared to Season 1, it remains solid overall. The character designs, while sometimes simpler, still manage to maintain the unique flair that the world of Tower of God requires. The fights are fluid, intense, and visually engaging, though the occasional dip in quality can be noticeable. The backgrounds remain rich, complementing the dark and mysterious atmosphere of the Tower itself.

Sound (10/10):
One of the standout aspects of this season is undoubtedly the sound design. Both the opening and ending themes hit the right notes, providing hype and encapsulating the themes of the story in both music and lyrics. The OST does a fantastic job of setting the tone for key moments, whether it’s during a battle or a quiet, reflective scene. The sound design greatly enhances the viewing experience, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll.

Enjoyment (9/10):
Despite its pacing issues and the occasional animation hiccup, I thoroughly enjoyed this season. Return of the Prince sets the stage for an even bigger and more dramatic arc to come, leaving fans hungry for more. While it would have been nice to see certain moments from the source material included, the anime does a good job of keeping the core elements intact and delivering an enjoyable experience on its own merits.

Overall (9.0/10):
Tower of God: Season 2 delivers a compelling narrative with well-crafted characters, impressive sound design, and a solid buildup to future events. Though not perfect, it is a highly enjoyable season that continues to build excitement for what's to come. As an adaptation, it stands strong on its own without being a direct carbon copy of the Manhwa, and that is something worth appreciating."
58426,537505.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Have you ever got the feeling that a show was only ""just good"", even though you've had unreasonably high expectations for it to be an all-time classic? Shikanokonokonokokoshitantan was the show for me, and the part that scares me is how my negativity may be a reflection of the existential reality that I'm getting older and am slowly losing interest in shows like these. Let me explain. When I was younger, I've held Oota's shows (mostly from Doga Kobo, sometimes other studios) in high regard as some of the best examples of comedy: Yuru Yuri, Gabriel Dropout, Umaru, the first season of Minami-ke, hell even Uzamaidwere all classics in my book, being exceptionally well directed comedies that are just the right amount of wacky while having memorable characters and scenarios. And there is Sabagebu which is arguably the greatest show of all time. So, after a lull in the 20s with a fairly mediocre Onipan, which I then chalked up to being a kid's show, him and his team are coming back with a new proper full length show in the form of a funny deer show. The OP came out and became a huge meme on YouTube, I don't know why, but that just hyped me up even further. I was ecstatic, finally I could relieve all those carefree days where I didn't have to worry much and could enjoy anime all day.

Then I watched the show. And then I finished it. I enjoyed it. I even thought it was fine, with a handful of exceptional, really funny moments. But that's the thing, maybe it's an age thing, but something felt missing from the show. Something that would have taken this show to all new heights and become an all time classic, but as it stands it's mostly just fine. Not that the show was lacking in wacky and unpredictable moments, it has that in spades. But honestly this time round I'm more attuned to the show's negatives than I am to simply accept the show on its own. The show's humor can honestly feel overly referential (haha the artstyle changed isn't that hilarious), or overly random but without an actual meaningful point being made. Then the more I thought, the more I am aware that the shows I mentioned earlier, back in the second paragraph... don't those shows have the same issues as well? 

I can't go back and take an objective look at the shows I once enjoyed. If I were to rewatch those older shows, I will most likely ignore the same flaws I can't help but notice in Shikanoko. But the thing is, I'm afraid to even go back to those shows, and that terrifies me. There is a part of me that seemingly realizes that maybe my tastes have changed over the years, I've gotten older, and I have way more occupying my life than anime. And so, this brings me back to the show itself. Is it good? Yeah, I think it's fine. It's funny in a lot of places. But for all its worth, it just didn't fully click with me the way other similar shows have.

But crucially, is it all that different from the shows I have mentioned earlier? The sad truth to this is that, it really isn't. It's at its core, a wacky comedy that is very similar to shows like Yuru Yuri or Umaru, and the fact that I can't bring myself to enjoy this show as much as those shows shakes me to my very core."
58426,537516.0,3.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"OH MY DEER, this anime is just terrible. I can't stress enough how badly this anime does comedy and over relies on a single punchline repeated for 12 episodes straight. Where else would you find an anime that is called Brainrot other than Shikanoko? It is unfathomable how this anime managed to keep a fanbase after 3 episodes worth. I can't belie- ""And now, while my logical side is rambling, welcome to the intermission break, where we discuss the sheer deer of the deer anime."" Deer Mode: The deer opening is very endeering and by far the most deerlicious part of this anime. The cast brought outtheir A-game to elevate this opening up to an 11. It's also the single reason why my deer booty is watching the deer girl in the first place. Just as voice actress Megumi Han once said, ""Don't think, just feel."" To top it off, you're given front-row seats to some ""Award-winning"" ahh performances from Rui Tanabe and Megumi Han, particularly the former. She does the Yandere act so immaculately perfect, that you will be brought back to heaven from a single utter of her voice.

Deer Mode: I must stress further about the clever easter eggs the deer cast has managed to deliver, the deer eyecatchers, the 4th wall breaks, and pop culture as deeeee perfect reference for more laughs and giggles in the anime. In this catering of deer biscuits, we got your favorite memes appearing again in a deer anime, characters behaving normally in a chaotic situation, cults, Koshi Torako being the only sensible person in her group of crackheads. The deer card acts wildly. Maybe the true treasure were the deers along the way.

""Oops, looks like my logical side is getting louder. We'll be back shortly.""

Logic Mode: The only good part about this anime is the easter eggs and pop references, anything else this anime has to offer is just complete garbage. The joke itself is so predictable that even a Scientologist can predict the next joke by a mile away, the delivery of the joke is so flat that any laugh you'll let out is just a blood-curdling one that makes you rethink about living life. It is just suffering to watch this anime and expect a single giggle from this anime. When you see Shikanoko open her head and you see the inside is empty, that's how much brain is given into these godforsaken jokes. 

Logic Mode: I think the worst part about Shikanoko is that these characters are very inconsistent whenever you go into a new scenario. You can tell the jokes pretty much only focus on Shikanoko being an autistic deer for the entire anime and you have Koshitan watching her impulses going wild like a deer trampede. Any characters involved all act like nothing odd is happening and when you get to the extreme characters like Anko, she is just so tropey that it's exhausting. Nekoyamada and Bashame were acceptable at best because they were pretty adorable to watch. This is not a debate, you'll get some short giggles sure, but it is unlikely that you'll find yourself having a good time watching it from start to finish.

Deer Mode: But... the opening is fun!

Logic Mode: Well that's why you don't believe in the rumor ""In every good anime lies a good opening."". I rest my case."

Overall it was a fun watch thanks to the absurdity; I’d be content if it didn’t return for a second season, however if that happens I’ll be pleasantly surprised. Only complaint I have about it is how everyone except Koshi accepts everything that happens with a smile. I get that’s part of the joke: Shikanoko does something absurd and everyone else accepts it as normal behavior while Koshi is flabbergasted; but it kinda feels overused by theend of the show. I did like the Treasurer’s brother and would have liked to see him more outside of the coffee shop scene, it was nice to have someone other than Koshi point out the absurdity."

This show relies pretty much 100% on ""random = funny"" which just doesn't do it for me. It got me chuckling maybe a few times in the first and second episode but that's about it, the ""randomness"" aspect stops working very early, specially when it stops being random and its just expected. I think the show could've been better if it had a structure simillar to Saiki, where each episode is 5 minutes long. Then you would consume it in small burstsinstead of 20 minutes where jokes get old really fast.

However, it didn’t take long for the jokes to stop working on me. They felt forced Randomness ≠ funny. They're overusing the cartoonish style of comedy (whatever it's called) and parodies, some of which I don’t even recognize. Also, 4th wall breaks aren’t as effective now as they were 10 years ago. Leaving all that aside, the foreshadowing in EP.1 is actually good—I'll give them that one. I wait for an episode every week only to fall asleep while watching? Ifyou're looking for a cute girl doing cute and funny stuffs (real funny stuffs) anime, then I highly recommend watching Asobi Asobase and Dragon Maid instead."
58426,537706.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"It's not terribly unfunny and unwatchable, it just doesn't know how to do comedy or a comedy series cast. I can compare it to two anime, Bocchi the Rock and Cromartie Koukou. Bocchi has great visual comedy, an emotional core and a colorful interesting cast, that adds variety to the gags. Shikanoko would most likely profit from being only Koshi and Noko, as the rest of the cast is just white noise, they don't add anything, they don't have any interesting routines or gimmicks to the add to the comedy. They have a singular line (joke) and repeat it whenever they are on screen. However, evenif the rest of the pointless cast was removed, there'd be one issue remaining: Koshi is a terrible tsukkomi. The straight man only being able to explain the joke is where comedy goes to die. There were very few gags in which Koshi's commentary added to it, instead of dragging it down. When Koshi is the boke and there's no tsukkomi's is when the gags flow the best, and the creator not being able to realize that and invest more in it probably shows how they're just doing whatever, instead of trying to learn and improve at their art.

As for Cromartie, it also has more characters than the author can write gags for, and sometimes it also has a series of gags that just don't land. BUT 1) Kamiyama isn't the one ruining the jokes, and the series learned that having him join in can be more interesting than just freaking out at the outlandish events surrounding him. 2) Even when the joke isn't a killer, you can be engaged in the overall story or situation, or a character gimmick that wasn't very funny on their first gag does better on their return. Shikanoko has no love for its characters, so the viewer also won't be invested on what can happen to them, and neither for the gags, as they never evolve. 

The first two episodes are the best the show can offer, and while there were some gags between 3 and 11 that were smirkable, the overall rate of bombing makes the show one that can't be recommended to anyone looking to have a good time with a funny anime. If the last episode was funny, I'd be willing to say it was an okay show, at least, because it'd at least end on a high note, but it was 70% as unfunny as any episode. ""It's the final episode, so this HAS to happen"" isn't so funny a joke you get to do it 5 times, and the events that took place weren't interesting enough to forgive using genre staples as an excuse to write a bad finale. It's still shitposting even if you're just pretending.

If you need to experience the deer, watch the first two episodes and the finale, then go on with your day. It won't add anything to your life, but losing an hour of your day with a tentative bland comedy won't kill you either."
58426,539554.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Well I won't write some sort of professional review since I don't think this is an anime that has to be taken seriously. It's obvious that Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan it's an anime made for the brainrot and memes, something that you can watch while the brain is in shut down mode, which I feel it's the only indicated way to watch this anime. Personally I didn't understand a thing from these 12 episodes beside some memes since everything is so random. Like I said, the anime was most likely made for the brainrot and memes so those that started the anime expecting to see plot,character development, flashback stories and so on I'm sorry but you choose the wrong anime. 

I have no idea what score I could give it so I'll leave that field empty."
58426,537686.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Before the anime even started airing I had seen so much advertising about it alongside the famous brainrot dance video that it was really hard to miss this one. So when it comes to advertising, one has to say that they did a masterful job. Every Anime fan I knew was aware about the existence of ""Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan"", and was at least curious to check it out. When it comes to the actual content of the show I can only say that it was peak brainrot. This was packed with references to pop culture, memes, and even other anime and consisted of mostly gaghumor that was hit or miss. When adding to it the fact, that it lacked a coherent plot, it made for a chaotic viewing experience. I'm not exaggerating when I say that if you asked me what the anime is about, I couldn't give you a clear answer. Honestly, I’m not sure if that’s a good thing or not. 

It's important to mention that Animes like this are not meant to be taken serious, which is why it is always hard to give honest critique. So it's better to answer it in very simple terms. Can this anime be enjoyed? Most definitely. I had a fun time watching and found myself laughing to most of the gags which lead to an overall positive watching experience. Some of the running gags get old rather quick because they get overused a bit too much, but it doesn't get obnoxious. It all sorta works because the anime does not try to be more than it sets out to be and does not take itself serious. 

This is one of those Animes where you just have to turn your brain off and enjoy the utter madness that is unfolding on your screen without thinking too much about it. When it comes to the plot, you can't really expect too much from ""Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan"". The voice acting was fine and the opening remains deeply ingrained into the deepest corner of my brain, where it will probably remain for a while. If you enjoy comedy and gag humor and are looking for something light without a plot, where you can just turn your brain off, you'll probably enjoy this anime."
58426,537531.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I'm going to miss it now that it's over, it was so fun and made me laugh a lot in that last episode, I'll miss the references and the nonsensical scenes with Nokotan that made me laugh or even give me a little relief for the day. I liked it, I laughed, I was ""moved"", and I got involved during the episodes, just as the narration itself says, you shouldn't care about the details or anything, just so you can enjoy the anime more, just watch and appreciate without understanding . In a way, I felt there was a lack of more involvement for the secondarycharacters to be more involved in the story than just being present in the scenes or giving opinions, but having nokotan and koshitan was good.

I understand that you don't like it, but the majority who say they don't like it have barely finished the anime, or at least like the humor genre (yes, I saw most of the profiles that wrote reviews), so there isn't much to say.

Enjoy the anime, it's fun, get the references, you don't need to turn off your brain to watch the anime or anything like that, just watch it normally with the intention of enjoying nokotan by bringing problems to koshitan.

NUUUUUNT"
58426,538392.0,2.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"So i actually checked it out because people seemed to talk about it a bit once it came out, and it actually seemed promising to be honest. So I watched the first episode and……. it wasn’t bad to be honest. Actually enjoyed it but oh boy….. little did I knew that Was going to be the only good episode… After that it was “Worst’s character tropes in anime: The animation ” Every character introduced afterwards was just horrible. The crazy obsessive one, the stupid one, the serious one… they just choose the worst tropes to put into this anime. Not only that but this anime’scomedy is literally that scene in SpongeBob of “Look at the funny face!”  Its comedy relies on Nokotan’s funni face/behavior and the funni deer… as if it wasn’t funny the first couple of 20 times. :D So yeahh…..and it never goes anywhere.. (Not that an anime that’s a comedy needs to have one but, at least, you know, be funny?) Even if you don’t mind your anime cliches and just want to ironically laugh at something, yeah it’s still not good. Unless you want to laugh at the same joke for the 20th time. It had potential to be good but oh well."
58426,537518.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan is your typical gag humor anime with new absurd situations every episode. We have a two main characters Koshi and Shikanoko. Koshi is a young girl who was a gang member before and now try to be a perfect girl in her new school and hide her past. While Shikanoko is….a deer? Well it was not full explained but we know she is a deer. Basically in the anime Koshi opens a deer club where the main point is to take care of deers ( just Shikanoko) and we have two other member. Mostly we see very absurd situation happening in theclub and mostly Koshi is the main victim.

This anime is a mediocre comedy for me. There were a lot of joke that I just didn’t find funny and even had moments that I felt bored. Which shouldn’t happening in comedy. My biggest problem is that there were a lot of great jokes that can done and a lot of great scenarios that the anime just leaves and continuous with something unfunny. My second biggest complain is the side cast. Expect of Neko everyone was boring. We didnt have interesting moments with them. They were just there…for example Bashame is a girl obsessed with rice and lazy. Thats all. We dont get any different joke from here and after second time its start to be repetitive. Same with others.

As a main cast is the best part of the series. Koshi and Shikanoko works perfectly together and the best jokes were made when it were just them. Koshi's reactions saved so many moments 

I defiantly enjoyed the art style and chibi and ghost Shikanoko. Her changing appearance every minute actually worked for me I liked her expressions it was funny and cute. Every character looks cute and different which I appreciate.The voice acting was done perfectly for me. Everything was just perfect. 

Lastly yea the Opening is perfect. Its catchy its fun and sounds good Im sure a lot of people started this anime must because of Opening. Its a good one.

Who should watch it? If you like a gag humor with cute characters a still think you should try it. Im sure a lot of people gonna like the humor in it. Its not the worst comedy out of there just pretty mediocre"
58426,537553.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Others: This anime is brain rot. Me: Yes. And? My Deer Friend Noko-tan is one of the better comedies to come out in recent seasons. It's certainly one of the most memorable, if nothing else. The sheer amount of gags they manage to create from deer is ridiculous and fantastic in equal measure. That's one of the things I respect most, when anime can take a singular focus and go all-in, taking it far beyond any conceivable limits, and Noko-tan exemplifies this completely. (But what about the accusations that this show is just mindless brain rot? Didn't your intro to this review imply you agree with it?) That'sthe point. The point is, it's pointless. Noko-tan is dumb, insane, all over the place, and it's all the better for it. A coworker of mine commented a while ago that Dadaism seems to be on the rise, a hundred or so years after it was originally coined. The idea behind that artistic movement is that not everything needs to have some profound point, not everything needs to be taken seriously. I genuinely think my coworker is onto something, though I'd peg the 21st century resurgence to be a little bit earlier than now, nearer to the era of YouTube Poop. But it still rings true. You don't need to turn your brain off completely, so long as you can sit down comfortably in the roller coaster, buckle up, and let yourself get taken for a ride. That's precisely the experience Noko-tan attempts and succeeds at giving the viewers.

Is this anime peak comedy? No. Is it great comedy? Deer god, yes! The timing and setup for gags are executed wonderfully, taking turns and twists out of nowhere, while maintaining a rapid-fire pace that achieves a lot of comedic payoffs in its runtime. All this because the creator apparently had a wacky idea one day about a girl with deer antlers, and imagined a world around that girl, and this anime is their vision brought to life. Everything that happens is a direct result of this insane type of world-building, with gag setups that are as ingenious as they are psychotic. Everything might be centralized on deer, but that in itself is a major achievement. In that respect, Noko-tan is one of the most creative animes I've ever seen.

To offer a bit of pointed criticism, I think Bashame is a bit of an underutilized character. Between the main cast, her personality is the most one-dimensional, and most gags beyond her introduction are just, girl likes rice because deer haha. There's no chaotic antics like Shikanoko, no sharp straight-man retorts like Torako, and no spicy siscon obsession to counterbalance the deer hijinks like Anko. Plus, I said this anime is memorable, and taken as a whole, it is, but individual scenes and setups blend together, and I find it difficult to remember what all happened during the middle section, having watched the anime as each episode aired. I could rewatch them and enjoy it just as much, but it doesn't have the same lasting impact as other great comedies.

I had two goals with this review: to leave a positive rating and wholehearted recommendation, and to address the disparity between existing positive and negative reviews, because as of time of writing, the number of reviews that don't recommend Noko-tan dwarf those that do with a tally of 27 negative to 17 positive. I'm not trying to disparage those reviewers or imply in any way that they're wrong - this anime genuinely isn't for everyone and that's fine! - but I find the ratio strange. Compare the user ratings for Noko-tan to Joshiraku and The Vampire Dies in No Time, two other shows with wacky, bizarre, rapid-fire, barely-continuous comedy and plot progression, both with a similar average user score (7.44 and 7.27 compared to Noko-tan's 7.31). Both of those shows have barely a handful of negative reviews compared to swathes of positive ones. (Incidentally, I recommend all three, for virtually identical reasons.)

So why are people just now feeling compelled to voice their displeasure? Is it some kind of societal pushback against meme culture and its impact on the broader Internet? Is it just because it's vogue and trendy to attack and vilify Generation Z? Should I invoke the spirit of Alex Jones and claim it's a far-left conspiracy to condemn and eliminate dumb and simple fun anime that refuse to push any sort of liberal agenda? Are these people just unhappy and don't like fun? Really, only one of these thoughts makes any amount of sense (obviously the third one) but even so, it still baffles me how this anime specifically has come under fire. As someone born in 1997, I consider myself to be between the Millennial and Z generations, and this has led me to having a bit of a nuanced perspective. I remember recently enough, how much flak the Millennial generation was getting for being terminally online and dumb, too idealistic to have any meaningful real-world practical knowledge - and I agreed with a lot of this at the time, but I've come around to see it all as mostly baseless criticism levied against them by Boomers, Gen X and Gen Y. We're seeing the exact same thing happening again, but towards Gen Z. Because of that, I think it's far too early to draw any major conclusions about the broader societal impacts of these trends, since all it amounts to is stereotyping. All this to say, criticizing this anime purely on the grounds that TikTok is dumb and so is the generation that uses it, is doing a huge disservice to the actual quality and creativity shown by this anime, as well as being willfully ignorant of the other myriad absurd shows and elements that have been in the anime medium throughout the 21st century, not to mention the Internet in the mid-2000s.

At the end of the day, just look at the premise for this show, and a small handful of the things people are saying about it. You'll know immediately whether it's hot trash or a comedic gold mine. Because you will lose brain cells from having watched this anime. To me, it was completely worth it."
58426,537467.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"My Deer Friend Nokotan - Has AniManga gone too far trying to find a fit into cultural relevance, being too much of something that never ended being a good thing...or is it? Also, why are humans not deer? Take a gander around the AniManga industry since the turn of the millennium, and a quarter-century later, anime has become quite the boom since post-COVID 2020s globally. But within its home region, Japan has always been headfirst at setting the anime Billboard trend of What's Hot to decide since its boom in the late 1970s and early 1980s to now, and the cultral effect is still felt today...withthe overwashing of bad to mediocre Isekai/fantasy works, with some standing out amongst the pack to (objectively) good degree.

However, there is one genre that plays this game differently, and that is comedy, and for a very good reason. The ""Comedy is Subjective"" argument has been a mainstay, especially within the last 15 years or so for works that embrace comedy quite literally. Works like famed mangaka Hideaki Sorachi's juggernaut of the Gintama franchise, to Kenji Inoue's double-whammy works of the great Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu a.k.a Baka and Test series to the masterpiece that is Summer 2018's Grand Blue, as well as my subjected favourite of Rin Suzukawa's Asobi Asobase (from the same season), there are great reasons to why these shows could be part of the lists of Top 10 comedy anime of all time. And in this Summer season, more than anything, we have yet another contender for the exact same argument that couldn't have come at a better time: Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan a.k.a My Deer Friend Nokotan, the AniManga industry's second coming(?) of KyoAni's Nichijou, but only manifested in brainrot to the point of absurdity and disbelief, made by the one and only Oshioshio a.k.a Oshio-mama, the mangaka best known for being the famed VTuber character designer for Hololive's Amane Kanata and Nijisanji's Sorahoshi Kirame. And loyal followers will say that this work is her revenge against Hololive for what they did to Kanata with the disservice that she got. 

Shika! Shika, Shika, Shika, Shika, Shi...ka!

It's actually interesting how Oshioshio came up with this rather surrealistic premise...or rather, INTENTIONALLY made. The story goes like this: ""One day, by chance, I came up with the idea of a girl character whose antlers were stuck on a door. I thought this could be interesting, so I thought of a story and other characters, and the work “My Deer Friend Nokotan” was born. Nokotan was not just any creature with horns, but I wanted it to be familiar and new, so I decided on a deer. In Japan, there are tourist attractions where deer are famous, which everyone knows, so I thought it would be familiar.""

And believe it or not, Wit Studio producer Naokado Fujiyama took that assignment to heart and basically elevated Oshioshio's gag manga, with the help of the one-and-only person who is right for this rather insane job: director Masahiko Oota, who's directorial duties have always been with Doga Kobo in the 2010s with shows like the Yuru Yuri series, Winter 2013's Kotoura-san, Winter 2017's Gabriel DropOut, and many more. However, it's his work adapting managaka SankakuHead's Himouto! Umaru-chan in the mid-2010s, that would capture Fujiyama and the producers enough to want to have the acclaimed brainrot director to collab on the now insanely viral anime that has made quite the waves all around the internet, digging at our already inept human society's IQ down the drain even further. Even Gigguk a.k.a Garnt, has the cheek to exclaim that ""this (Masahiko Oota) is a director that had his brainrot training arc, he was like: I've given the world (Himouto) Umaru-chan, but I have not gone far enough...we need to go further, we need to go further!"" This is the personification of a shitpost anime, and lose your brain cells now because this ride is finna be a wild Skibidi toilet located in Ohio, Gyatt.

To say that Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan both set the trend and destroyed its record throughout the Summer 2024 season, is literally an understatement to the surreal degree. The TL;DR is this: the female MC, a former delinquent inspired by Tokyo Revengers's Mikey, turned goody-two shoes of her school being the student council president, meets a deer-human-hybrid, because she can be one hell of a mixed-gender odd ball of a Shika, being a girl but with antlers that only male deers will have. That coincidence meets both girls together in school to produce one heck of an insanity show where it's like the movie ""Everything, Everywhere, All at Once,"" but you still won't know what shenanigans you're exactly in for. With a pristine walk filled with boss music that rivals Kimetsu no Yaiba a.k.a Demon Slayer's main villain antagonist Muzan Kibutsuji's Michael Jackson-inspired slow moonwalk, everybody accepts the deer-human-hybrid, Noko ""Nokotan"" Shikanoko for who she is, except that the student council president, Torako ""Koshitan"" Koshi, knows her shtick so well that she begins to question the sanity of her classmates and teacher who just goes with the flow and act like she's just a regular schoolgirl. To make matters worse, the mayhem doesn't stop there as Nokotan's antics force Koshitan to have second thoughts being forced to her will, even going as far as to create the eponymous Deer Club, adding in even more hysterical people who're just as crazy as they come...because no one's normal in their aforementioned Hinominami High School in Hino City.

That's Episode 1 in a nutshell, and it's unironically one of (if not) THE BEST premiere episodes of the season, telling us, the audience, that we are NOT ready for what's to come of the weird and batshit insanity that is Nokotan. Also, don't think too much about the show being a turn-off-your-brain delulu comedy series, because it is intentionally made that way, laden with deer crackers that can only be Fanum Tax-ed by Nokotan herself.

The VAs stocks arise stonks this season, thanks to famed stars like Saki Fujita for being famed Vocaloid Hatsune Miku, as well as Megumi Han, whom IMO, steals the spotlight for the Summer season in the female Seiyuu department, as not just the Bell Pepper child idol Kana Arima for Oshi no Ko's return for Season 2 with the much-anticipated Tokyo Blade arc, but also the titular weirdo of the hybrid deer. It's without a doubt that both VAs had a wild time of recording sessions just to showcase the limitless potential of Oshioshio's manga when it comes to pure, unhinged idiocy, so much so that as the series progresses, you don't start to question if the show was truly great or bad to begin with, but how far this acid trip of a gag manga will showcase anything AND everything that it so desires just to achieve what the staff team wanted out of the anime. Even it's side cast from Koshi's crazy yandere of a siscon through Anko, the rice-paddy fanatic of Meme Bashame (yes, her name is exactly just that, VA-ed by Fuuka Izumi as Mahou Shoujo ni Akogarete a.k.a Gushing Over Magical Girl's female MC Utena Hiiragi/Magia Baiser), and even the student council members (none of which they're typical), you can loathe them all you want, but they're excellent characters who do their role justice, even if it's just for the sacrifice of the comedy alone. And however you deem the anime eventually to be the masterpiece or the dumpster fire that it is, it achieves the one SOLE thing that it's supposed to do: be viral and meme the hell of what is already an incomprehensible source material work to extreme insanity. And it worked.

Seriously though, the single-handed best trait of the anime is in its marketing (please SERIOUSLY take notes, producers), and this is where the series finds its strength being ingrained towards cultural relevance, not just on a domestic, but on an unpredecent global reach. More than just the erratic PVs, which get weirder with every release, within just the month before its debut, the Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitan opening jingle has become the talk of the town...and slowly becoming a viral riot hit all across social media, racking up millions in views and inspiring a whole host of influencers to take notes from the OP and make it their wholly own, from literate cosplays of Nokotan dancing to real-life deers, to MVs ranging from LittleVMills's Metalcore cover song, to the far ranges of Bollywood being a musical fusion fest that fits so perfectly, you could even make it your ringtone for your smartphone device. There's even an hour-long version of the jingle to test your mental capability of lasting just the repeated 5 second-long jingle for 60 minutes on end, so have fun with that.

All jokes aside though, the request from both anime and music production companies of Twin Engine and Lantis requesting music director Masamitsu Fujimori and composer Yuxiki Waga to concoct an out-of-this-world OP song that they ever mustered, and I have to say that Shikairo Days is the PERFECT brainrot of an OP song for the job. It has everything you ever needed to get to know the series in depth from the get go, from purely anime-only references like the all-female cast jumping together (which was a staple trait for moe shows back in the day, because everyone jumping together in the OP makes it a god-tier masterpiece), to clear-cut references like Dark Souls with the ""You (Dead) Deer"" reference, as well as Tokyo Ghoul with all the deer and the sky-land reflection. Even the title itself is a reference to Gurren Lagann's OP ""Sorairo Days,"" and more by the stretch of imagination. You can't tell me that you've gone out and about the past 3 months, and NOT see a hint of the series' now signature brainrot of a jingle that completely took both the internet and social media to meme-level territory of hypnotic infamy levels. The ED, which is just a glorfied Nara Prefecture advertisement to see the creation of Shika-senbei a.k.a deer crackers, ehh...it's alright.

To make the icing on the cake even better, this is produced by one of the most GOAT-ed anime studios of all time at the helm. Wit Studio is in the midst of its comeback shedding its masterful past and trying to be different going forward, but IMO, Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan is the studio's newest Shingeki no Kyojin a.k.a Attack on Titan face of the 2020s, that the uncanny resemblance down to its Japanese-equivalent first-letter initials (SnK) has people like Gigguk exclaiming, ""Wit Studio, quit Attack on Titan, to work on this show (My Deer Friend Nokotan)...we've gone from one of the most iconic anime of all time, to yet another new iconic anime of all time...but, BUT, DEER"". From the insanities of the 3DCG deer that just baffles both the mind and the laughter-inducing medicine the first few times that they appear on screen for no absolute reason other than to be (extra) comedy relief, to the no-surprise great animation that Wit Studio is known for (despite having Studio Massket for production assistance), these two things shouldn't have worked for something that is completely pedestrian to the average Joe. But you know what, Wit Studio and Nokotan's staff team under director Masahiko Oota defied the odds to give us Oshio-mama's series that, for all intents and purposes, is something worth remembering in 2024 alone.

At the end of it all, Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan a.k.a My Deer Friend Nokotan may have been a show where not all the jokes landed, and some were on the verge of just being braindead and having nothing to offer to the point of being bland (which I totally understand and have been in those shoes within the weak episodes themselves), but this series is truly the pinnacle definition of ""it's not for everyone"", and the most important quote of all: Comedy IS Subjective.

Even if Nokotan gets all the love and hate one and all the same for 1001 reasons, I'd recommend you to at least try the 3-episode rule on this and see if it's your cup of tea. Either way, it's definitely a standout amongst the rather lukewarm Summer 2024 season, for better or for worse, for one thing and one thing only: being a perfectly curated PEAK brainrot of a WTF show.

Now, are you deer-ing enough to be willing to convert yourself to the cult of the deer? Come along for the ride...we're all en-Deer-ing for your arrival. Reject Humanity, Return to Deer...Shiiiiika!"
58426,537577.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Out of all of the “hype” anime that have been released and will be releasing this year, My Deer Friend Nokotan has to be the strangest out of the bunch. The only real reason why it even became popular this year was because the trailers for this anime, which also featured the OP, were so goofy that people were flocking to see this once it actually aired. Now, with that in mind, I hate to be that guy, but My Deer Friend Nokotan is… okay. It’s fine. I’m gonna keep this short because I don’t have a lot to say, but this anime is absolutely overhyped.What further drove the hype train for My Deer Friend Nokotan is that this anime is basically Nichijou 2.0, but with deers, and I guess you could call it that. This anime is just pure brain rot and there’s nothing wrong with that. There’s nothing wrong with having a movie or show, especially an animated project, being completely goofy and devoid of logic. I’ve said in other reviews that I actually prefer if comedic animated movies and shows, especially anime, fully embrace the comical nature side of things since you can do more in an animated medium over an on-screen, live-action venture. My Deer Friend Nokotan 100% accomplishes that quota, however, that doesn’t automatically make it “peak.”

What really holds back this anime has to be the actual comedy itself. This show is yet another self-aware comedic TV show that breaks the 4th wall a lot. I don’t mind when the writing is fully self-aware and understands just how stupid the overall atmosphere is, however there is a point where it becomes tiresome and over-bearing, and My Deer Friend Nokotan crosses that threshold over fifty times over. What I mean by that is every episode has both the characters, the narrator, and the overall setting of the show break the 4th wall in almost every other joke. I think it would’ve been fine if the show implemented this form of comedy sporadically and through what the characters do, but this anime utilizes this comedic element in almost every nook and cranny in the writing. Again, I fully understand that I’m supposed to turn my brain completely off while watching this anime, however there are times where I got annoyed with this show and how the comedy is implemented. If the characters are constantly talking about being *in* an anime and being a part of legacy TV media in every episode, it gets to a point where I’m just turned off by the show because it’s conveying how the peak level of humor that My Deer Friend Nokotan can muster up has to be constant 4th wall-breaking dialogue. The novelty wears off by the halfway point of the season and it just becomes very repetitive.

Speaking of repetitive, the characters and character dynamics are very monotonous. Don’t get me wrong, the comedy does have a bit of charm at first, but when the characters have the same interactions in almost every episode, I just lose interest because there is rarely anything unique or surprising that stood out to me or made it memorable. The two main characters, Noko Shikanoko, aka Nokotan, and Torako Koshi, aka Koshitan, share a lot of screen time with one another (obviously), but most of the scenes they do share are super formulaic and loses its charm very early on; Nokotan does some goofy shit and Koshitan acts surprised and gets mad at Noko. Other characters like Anko Koshi and Meme Bashame don’t really add much to the show as well because they have only one almost only one personality for like 90% of the show. Anko *really* loves her sister Torako and threatens anyone who so much as says anything adjacent to what can be perceived as negative to Koshitan while Bashame eats, grows, and talks about rice 24/7. I’m not looking for character development, but I really think that there could have been a fun and unique spin to all of the scenes with these characters so that the content written for them isn’t repetitive by the fifth or sixth episode.

Now, with all of that said, I don’t hate this anime. Despite all of the paragraphs in this review so far, it might seem like this anime is repulsive, but it’s really not. In fact, with how terrible the Summer 2024 seasonal slate has been, My Deer Friend Nokotan definitely adds a ton of life to my seasonal watch schedule. There have been moments where I did let out a slight chuckle, and the pop culture references are goofy and surprisingly implemented really well. Despite not being a massive fan of the comedic content in this show, I did have “fun.” Whenever the anime isn’t breaking the 4th wall, I was admittedly enjoying myself, however that really happens only half of the time.

I know this review might seem overly negative, but overall, My Deer Nokotan does achieve at being goofy fun and not shying away from that. Even though I really did not like the self-aware moments in the show, it still filled my fix for a goofy brain rot anime to watch. However, My Deer Nokotan isn’t really *that* funny. A lot of the jokes get very stale by the sixth episode or so and that can be attributed to how unoriginal and repetitive the quipping can be. Constant 4th wall breaking elements loses the specialty of being a self-aware comedy, but again, this is just a dumb goofy school anime featuring a human-deer hybrid. That said, there has been another anime that aired earlier this year that had similar tropes, but executed it just a little bit better, that being ‘Tis Time for “Torture,” Princess. That anime was just a tiny bit more smart with how it wanted to implement its comedy and I honestly had more fun watching that over My Deer Friend Nokotan. Again, this anime isn’t bad, but it isn’t really the “peak comedy” that it was hyped up to be. But that’s just my opinion."
58426,538633.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"An anime that was the victim of the hype of those who only heard its opening and those who did not understand its objective from the beginning. Nokotan came with one goal in mind, to be a 12-episode commercial for the preservation of deer in Japan. This means that by trying to promote a local cause, all the humor, references and jokes would also be for the locals. Obviously if you are familiar with Japanese humor, you will be able to find the humor in the jokes in this work. As for the references, a little knowledge or research is needed if you live outside ofJapan. There are allusions to many events, places or famous people that only a Japanese would recognize. Not everything is like this, since the anime knows that although its references are local, absurd humor is a universal language. Nokotan will always try to challenge your capacity for amazement, trying to create the most ridiculous scenarios possible. When you let the wave of absurdity absorb you, those 20 minutes of the episode can be the most fun of your day. The promotion section is very well done. Many times they will make you hear facts about the deer or encourage tourism in a certain area, in a way that you won't realize until the scene ends.

If you try to rate each of the anime episodes individually, I think the rating would be average or very low, except for a couple. When you get to the final episode, you understand that an individual evaluation would be meaningless, because you realize that 11 episodes are there to build the 12th episode. The last episode is a festival of characters, jokes and references to past episodes that manage to pull off the maneuver of putting everything seen in the anime in a single 20-minute episode.

People were very hard on this anime simply because they bought into the idea that this would be on the level of a Gintama or Grand Blue, due to them sailing in a similar humorous vein. If you can go in with zero expectations and see the charm of Nokotan and company, you can find a good source of fun."
58426,538234.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"A good entry into the ""shitposting sitcom"" genre that particularly works well while we wait for more Dropkick on my Devil. If you like Dropkick or Bocchi the Rock you'll be right at home here. The comedy pulls every out-of-left-field thing possible and constantly got me giggling. It almost feels like an anime version of Green Acres in the sense that the straight man character, Koshitan, is the only person who expects any kind of real-world logic but everyone in the town around her just immediately accepts whatever insanity Nokotan brings. I do think there are some critiques that can be made however. While the coreduo of Koshitan and Nokotan is hilarious, it doesn't really have a strong extended ensemble like Dropkick or Bocchi do. The exception being Bashame who is perhaps the most casually unhinged of the group, a sort of anime Creed Bratton if you will, but the other characters outside of Bashame are all kind of interchangeable in terms of basically existing to *fawn* over Nokotan. Koshitan's sister has a weird incestuous streak and Nekoyamada wants to destroy the deer club, that about it as far as other personalities go and none of the side characters really have any kind of depth. Even as hilarious as the main duo are, there isn't really much of a discernable character growth, Koshitan becomes more tolerant of Nokotan, but it's not like in Dropkick on my Devil where we gradually see Yurine and Jashin-chan appreciate each other more, here they just seem to get along better all of the sudden and since things are pretty strictly focused on the gag you don't get those deeper character moments that elevate similar zany comedies.

Still, when the show is funny it's hilarious and it's basically always funny. The sheer breadth and variety of gags is amazing and the running gag of realistic deer being rendered with completely jarring CGI never gets old. All the ways they work various deer-related elements into every little aspsect, the ""shiiiii-ka (deer)"" chanting, the slapstick, it's all gold. The visuals are also much nicer than you'd expect for this type of show and the animation and character designs are deeply appealing. I think this is a new absurdist classic in terms of comedy, but don't expect anything deep."
58426,537491.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"This was one of the weirder anime of the season and to be honest I'm going to miss it. The characters were endearing and the wtfness of the episodes kept me coming back for more. I really enjoyed that Shikanoko seemed like a deer turned into a girl because there are a lot of deer where I live so her personality seemed spot on. I also liked that the most bizarre things would happen at random. That said, there were times where the jokes felt flat or were just a little too weird and I could feel my brain melting a little (/not affectionate). However,despite the slips along the way, I had a good time and had something to laugh at every episode. I think if I didn't come from an area with deer I might not have put up with this anime as well as I did. 

If you're looking for something that's a little weird and at times funny, then do give this anime a chance. If you want something that doesn't veer into wtf territory, then a different comedy is probably best."
58426,537907.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"This anime is like a wild acid trip, where nothing makes sense, but actually, everything does because it doesn’t have to, and nothing needs an explanation. It’s like that from start to finish, making it clear to the audience that there's no room for false expectations. It sticks to an unusual comedy formula, but it really depends on what you find funny and what kind of humor works for you. For me, it worked great, and overall, it was a solid anime. I really liked how episode 11 ended with a cliffhanger—something super unexpected happened, and coming from this anime, you can’t help but feel curious.But what happens in episode 12 is literally the last thing I would've expected—dumb and genius at the same time. After finishing Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan, that was my impression. I’d easily recommend it, give it a shot."
58426,538125.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"This anime is the pure definition of ""good shit"" . Random things happen, always pushed to the extreme and it's extremely funny, if you want to laugh, or just empty your thougts go give it a watch it's worth it! My opinion about this mess: Story 7/10 The story is good, the plot is okay but nothing special, Nokotan really carry the whole plot but it's still funny asf. There is no unnecessary development we just follow the girls and their daily life at their crazy club, it's pretty chill and more importantly it doesn't feel repetitive. Characters 9/10 They have backstorys which are good, they are well introducedand they aren't annoying apart from the sister who's clingy af but that's her personality and at the end of the show she isn't annoying anymore

Music and opening 10/10
You SURELY heard the opening on tiktok or whatever but this shit is goated but you cannot get it out of your head! The ending is very underrated because it's not as popular as the op and the themes are very funny it just says deer in japanese like a boss ending fight (idk if yk what i mean) 

Animation 7/10
It's okay but in the transitions there is no big effort, they just searched random locations in Japan (related in some way to the deer) and they put their characters in there but it's just the transitions so we don't really care. The animation is okay nothing crazy but good to watch.

Overall 8/10
Honestly at first thought i'd give it a 7  it's one of the funniest anime i've ever watched  and i was never bored when i watched it! Give it a try ad you'll see!"
58426,537943.0,6.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Okay, this is one I just gotta review. Back when I worked for , I used to have to work with . Their firmware was so incomprehensible and difficult to manage I used to half-joke that their firmware team was stuck in a room with a pile of crack and a deadline. I never once thought I would find an anime that could apply that same thought to. There's no way illegal substances weren't somehow involved in the production of this anime in some form. No way. This is what would happen if Salvador Dali and Gallagher teamed up andmade an anime.

This anime is incomprehensible.  It's not funny so much as it's surreal and the funny moments come directly from the surreality.  If you're  expecting anything but the barest of plots, any kind of story consistency at all, any sensible moments whatsoever, you're not going to find them here.  Seriously.  This anime is best described as a story created by a four year old, I actually, literally got those vibes.  Like when you're sitting with a four year old and she wants to tell you a story, and then she spins this absolutely fantastical story that is absolutely the most hilarious thing you've ever heard simply because it's so absolutely unhinged, but you're not allowed to laugh because she's delivering it with the most serious gravity her little four year old voice can muster and she absolutely means every word.

This anime is so bad it rotates right around into good again, and this is maybe the only anime I've ever actually been able to say this about.  I can't think of others offhand.

I generally don't mind an anime that doesn't take itself seriously.  I've rated a few pretty highly when no one else did simply because I recognized that the producers of the anime never intended for it to be taken seriously, and couldn't really dock it for much because of that.  So why am I not giving the same grace to this anime?  Simple.  Because they want you to know they're not taking it seriously.  They have banners, skywriting, flaming 200 foot tall letters on a mountain saying ""WE ARE NOT TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY"", and when they have to make that much effort into making absolutely, positively clear that they're not taking it seriously, well, that becomes taking not taking it seriously, seriously, and it loses all of its ""don't give a fart"" charms.

I can't believe I watched this.  I wasted something like five hours of my life watching this absolute brainrot, and while it was definitely a ride, and I definitely did laugh on occasions - ok, a lot - I left feeling like there was absolutely nothing at all of value I took from it.  Even the music was unhinged (the ED is just a stupid, badly sung march overlaid with video of real-life people making deer crackers).  Everything about this anime was, simply, absolutely unhinged, and I think I would have been better off, well, doing absolutely anything else.  Anything at all.

If you want an anime which is utterly unhinged, has no redeeming value whatsoever, no fanservice, no ecchi, no plot, no sense, no real story, no drama (that isn't immediately destroyed by a stupid comment by the narrator), no anything but a cheap, Salvador Dali-esque sense of suurealism, well...  here you are.  Enjoy.

Personally, though, I can't really recommend.  You might like it.  But I can't in good conscience say you will."
57524,538761.0,8.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"There are few media as recursive as the modern light novel industry. Whenever anything succeeds in this space, there will immediately be waves of imitators trying to capitalize on that success by using the same surface level elements. You know what I’m talking about – villainesses, abandoned by my party, cheat skills, reincarnated as something unusual, the list goes on and on. But the light novel fad that most fascinates me is “self-aware”. In an environment where a large number of the works present are just Frankensteined together collections of tropes, it’s only natural that some works would emerge that make a point of drawingattention to how trope-y they are. And really, who doesn’t love seeing the same tired tropes again and again as long as they’re accompanied by a wink and a nudge?

The appeal of “self-aware” works for me is that they serve as an invitation to deconstruct the tropes that they’re working with. Like, it’s interesting to me how Nukumizu is himself a web novelist. It’s extremely common in this type of series to see the protagonist reading light novels or living in a room covered in Aniplex posters and figures, but this is the first example I can think of where the protagonist is a writer in this space, at least without it being central to the plot. These protagonists, loners who have trouble initiating social interactions, are meant to serve as relatable self-inserts, so this decision is Makeine presenting itself as the light novelist’s light novel.

Or, let’s break down our heroines a little bit. One of Makeine’s strong points is that neither Nukumizu or the girls are looking at each other as potential romantic partners, although the audience is still encouraged to imagine dating one of them. Or the sister, for some reason. Yanami Anna is the popular girl who would totally get you if she just took the time to get to know you, who will bring you out of your shell by introducing you to colorful new experiences. Komari Chika is basically a girl version of you! She shares all of your hobbies and interests and will always understand your otaku references. And she’s got crippling social anxiety, so you get to be her hero! And then there’s Yakishio Lemon, who’s a sporty tomboy, I guess. Honestly, I don’t see what the wish fulfillment angle is supposed to be here, and I don’t understand why she was the most favorited character from this show on this site about halfway through its run. Are you all just tanline perverts? If you’re someone who had favorited Lemon earlier in the show’s run, but have since rescinded that, I want you to know that I’m fascinated by you, and please message me, because I’m desperate to know more.

But while I’d love to talk about deconstructing light novel tropes all day, I know that’s not what you’re here for. So instead, let’s talk about what really matters. Let’s talk about Yanami Anna.

Anna is an absolutely perfect character, and completely carries this entire show. As fans of the light novel will breathlessly tell you, Nukumizu isn’t an active presence as a protagonist at the beginning of the series, often just being there to voice uncertainties or to be a shoulder to lean on for other people’s character arcs. In contrast to that, Anna is a little full of herself, and is the type to act first and leave the thinking to other people, so she gets to drive a lot of the narrative for the first two arcs, by running into other people's drama headfirst, and dragging Nukumizu along for the ride. I love how much of the series is dedicated to someone approaching the two of them for advice, which then results in them going on what is functionally a date, while the distressed party has to awkwardly thirdwheel. Their chemistry is fantastic, and it's not just a dynamic that's fun to watch; it’s clear that the reason Nukumizu is able to grow as he does over the course of the series is because he has Anna’s company influencing him.

But Anna’s perfection extends beyond her role in the narrative. It’s clear that the animators were in love with her as well, because her animation is always so lively, and even when she’s just in the background, she’ll have some fun little sight gag going on. About two thirds of the time, she's being comically owned, which does actually serve to highlight her character's self-assurance. My personal favorite background Anna moment is when the gang are all together eating sushi, and she nabs the last piece of one of the rolls just as Nukumizu begins to reach for it. It’s just a little moment, but it’s filled with personality. This is absolutely the case of an adaptation that elevated its source material; Imigimuru's character designs perfectly lend themselves to animation, even if I'll never forgive him for those stupid quadruple bowties. I will concede that I feel Anna has the weakest ED of the three girls, but it’s still not a bad song by any means, and really, I think it’s always cool when an anime has character specific ending themes.

Okay, fine, there are things I liked about Makeine that weren't Yanami Anna. I liked how Nukumizu's relationships with the girls were all platonic, at least as far as this adaptation covers. I liked how present all of the cast was in each other's arcs; there's a genuine sense of community in the literature club. I especially liked Komari's arc, in part because we had already seen her development taking shape even before she formally stepped into the spotlight. While I talked earlier about Anna being a positive influence on Nukumizu, I think the same could be said for Lemon's effect on Komari. And I liked that we did spend some time getting to know the ""winning heroines"", even if this distinctly wasn't their story. But still, if I could choose between the story we got, and one which throws out all of the harem tropes and instead delivered on a classic romance story with Anna, well...

Earlier this year, Sousou no Frieren and Dungeon Meshi were smash hits, and it's noteworthy that both were traditional fantasy stories, undisguised by the ironic veneer of the isekai genre, written by mangaka unashamed of their own ideas. In episode 9 of Makeine, as a girl falls down a set of stairs towards our protagonist breast-first, he remarks that he recognizes this scenario from the light novels he's read. Light novel key words may be helpful for getting an author's work discovered, but it's the substance that determines whether it'll actually be remembered. And really, I do like Makeine's substance, so I wish that the author had more confidence in their work and didn't feel the need to bury it in tropes. What I hope I've communicated over the course of this review is that I'm the type of person to approach this sort of series with a lot of cynicism, and despite that, I absolutely fell in love. I think this anime excels at what it's trying to be, so much so that I wish it had tried to be something more ambitious. I'm sure there will be another season of Makeine, and I'm sure that I'll watch it when it comes out. But I won't be watching for more losing heroines, I'll be watching for Yanami Anna."
57524,538766.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"From the very first episode Makeine was my anime of the season and that’s not changed. The last 12 weeks have been a nonstop magical run from A-1 pictures and one of the most refreshing and enjoyable takes on the romcom genre. Makeine takes the usual harem male fantasy bait romcom formula and turns it on its head, instead focusing on platonic relationships, helping teenagers overcome heartbreak and move forward with their heads held high. I’m a big fan of the mature and somewhat realistic way the story handles this. You don’t always get what or who you want in real life, learning to acceptand deal with that is important. Even more important is not getting bitter or angry and instead seeing it as a growth opportunity, which the show focuses on. The well written story and character dynamics combined with some of the best production values A-1 have done, make this a must watch.

The relationship between Nukumizu and Anna is the best part of Makeine and the foundation on which the story is based. Rather than your usual boy meets girl and falls in love story, Nukumizu helps Anna accept and move on from the rejection of her crush. The best part of this is that they actually feel like real friends. Guys and girls have the ability to just be cool and hang out and I like that this story reflects that. Every single scene with them is just awesome and oozes with chemistry. While there’s obviously people out there that ship them, I really enjoy their relationship as is and hope it stays that way at least for a while. Her going out with him right after being rejected would just seem forced and too tropey.

That’s something we see play out throughout the story as well. The other characters get their hearts broken one by one and Nukumizu is there to support them, learning more about himself and other people in the process. But that’s not to say it ever gets repetitive. The sheer variety of personalities in this story are enough to make each experience feel unique. All of the rejected heroines are The author is very good at showing the complexities of human attraction and romance. Like just because we as the audience love a girl doesn’t mean a guy in the story will. You can’t help who you’re attracted to and sometimes despite being a good fit on paper it just doesn’t work out. Despite the obvious pain of those rejections, the characters in this resolve to move forward and not regret their unrequited love, but embrace it as a part of life which I think everyone can learn nothing or two from. Everything in life is a learning experience and makes you who you are to this day.

So the story’s great, but the other thing that really made me fall in love with Makeine is how good it looks. I’m not sure if it’s any of the same staff that worked on 86, I know most of them are busy on Nier Automata, but it had that sort of quality. Gorgeous and fluid animation with lively and vibrant colours and character designs. It really was a visual treat. It’s this great combination of production values and storytelling that really makes it stick out among a crowded romance field this season. The direction during some of the big confession and rejection scenes was enough to give me chills on more than one occasion. Hats off to the team that worked on this.

Had a blast with every single minute of this show and it rightfully deserved the love and hype it got. While it started off getting less love than roshidere, it overtook it by the end thanks to a phenomenal social media campaign keeping track of Anna’s calories and the various hilarious moments from the show. Truly one of my all time fave romcom series that doesn’t rely on fanservice or goonbait to be enjoyable. Focus on writing good characters and have lessons applicable to the real world and you’ll have a good seasonal anime.

Makeine gets a very easy 10 out of 10."
57524,538763.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Too Many Losing Heroines! - It's too easy being an average Joe, but yet still score loads of girls no matter the circumstances! So how about being the average Joe, but twisting the formula to be in the realm of the secondary girls instead? Of all the genres known to man, romance series are one of the easiest to write, but it's harder to nail its content, much less nail the intended ending that authors wanted to pen with their series, only to see it fail or get absolutely ridiculed by the fans. Case in point, the AniManga industry with its many romance, comedy, or thecombination of both genre's works over the decades that, for better or for worse, achieved what authors greatly wanted out of it through the exposure of as much content as it can be covered with anime adaptations, that gets the ire of fans always in their argument for ""shipping wars"" and the like, ugh. And it's exactly the same case for the Summer 2024 season, seeing a resurgence of the rom-com genre with as much as 10 shows under the seasonal belt focusing on those 2 genres alone. And in the midst of the usual mid- and low-tier contenders, one show EASILY stands out for its unique twist on the rom-com formula: novelist Takibi Amamori and Lycoris Recoil's character designer-cum-KonoBi illustrator Imigimuru's Make Heroine ga Oosugiru! a.k.a Too Many Losing Heroines!, a rom-com that throws your usual average Joe of a MC, into the lovey-dovey rhythms of girls...who are at the losing side of the romance streak? I can tell you now that being a fan of both the LN and its manga adaptation awaiting the anime's arrival this season, it certainly set expectations sky high, and I was NOT disappointed, not one bit at all. In fact, it exceeded expectations and set itself a brand-new standard for future romance series to come.

If you're a person of either sex, ask yourself this question: Am I born in this world to experience love like any other typical person does, or am I just cursed to become the background character as an Otaku who feels better being behind-the-scenes to help my friends get through their love issues and navigate them into a new being of ""love takes time to cultivate, and cultivate it naturally,""  even if it meant them moving on past their love phase to embrace much more than they ever could? If you answered the latter, welcome to MC protagonist Kazuhiko Nukumizu's world: the 1st-year high school student of Tsuwabuki High School, classified with a rather unique school uniform for the girls being embedded with 4 bowties (where the colours themselves hide a hint to the romance plot of the overall series), who's a rather reserved young man who always is fine being by himself and not being a social butterfly, though he is a chad who will offer good advice to the people around him. The problem that he has to face: heartbroken girls who he deems as ""losing heroines"" and helping them get over their heartbreak in good faith.

May I introduce to you the 3 girls and their deadly sins:
- The blue-haired charming classmate of Anna Yanami, who bears the Sin of Gluttony and Greed, covering Volume 1 of the LN (which the official website has a calorie count of what she ate for the series, despite still being able to keep slim, which is just absolutely WILD)
- The brown-haired althetic classmate of Lemon Yakishio, who bears the Sin of Wrath, covering Volume 2 of the LN
- The maroon-haired shy classmate of Chika Komari, who bears the Sin of Envy and Pride, covering Volume 3 of the LN

Without going into much detail of what the show entails (because the anime is just TOO GOOD of a rom-com masterpiece material that it'd be a waste to put all of this in the review), Nukumizu has his hands full of the girls who have their unique quirks and antics, and on top of the romance heartbreak that these 3 girls go through in their likeness, trying to circumvent each and every one of their circumstances is never a bed of roses for the Otaku. Everyone has their own lives and stories concocted so that no one story ever feels the same (even in similarity), and not only does it feel consistent, it is also congruent to the entire plot of intersecting characters within the circles of the losing heroines that everyone is connected in one way or another. Be it the winning heroes and their heroines that the losing heroines once had long-time crushes on the formers, and contemplated with the latters on their decisions that caused the rifts in the first place, Nukumizu has always been there for the 3 girls every step of the way in trying to help them understand the big picture of their failed relationships, and treat it with the harsh realism of real love that destroys all semblances of expectations to overpromise and underdeliver.

This has always been the BIG problem that exists within all romance series to deliver their version of love that, despite being fiction, it is rather unrealistic and toxic and that'll absolutely destroy character relations in the long run. But I have to say that for his debut work, Takibi Amamori is an absolute chad of an author to understand what goes into a relationship, as well as not pander to the mainstream to show the other side of the coin of failed relationships and how people can come out of it being better people than who they were before the fixtures. This is way more than just your typical rom-com, it's a in-depth look into the human hearts of the matter in terms of how people deal with typical relationships, and how people deal with the good and bad circumstances that make them who they are, as flawed humans wanting to be loved but finding themselves in situations that put them in a disadvantage, either for the pure romance or comedic hilarity, thus helping them overcome their issues and improving themselves. And this show gets it all, hook, line, and sinker, it's flawless, even down to the big cast of supporting characters who are just as atypical, if not weird and downright creepy at best, because there is NOT one normal person in this show (other than Nukumizu himself).

You know damn well when editors receive word about people wanting to make an anime out of works they want to create, and for Shogakukan's Gagaga Bunko editor-in-charge Kiwaasa, that is the pipedream that he got being all the way BEFORE the publication of the LN, which won the publication company's 15th LN Award (under a different title) that would eventually become the debut volume released in July 2021. This should show you that producers saw the potential of Tabiki Amamori's work before it got to the books, and that is a once-in-a-lifetime rarity of an achievement that very few works get in their lifetime, let alone a brand new work that was mainly influenced by various manga, the likes of Norio Sakurai's Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu a.k.a The Dangers In My Heart, Aka Akasaka's Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai a.k.a Kaguya-sama: Love is War, and fellow illustrator Imigimuru's Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! a.k.a This Art Club Has a Problem!, with BokuYaba and Kaguya-sama being inspirations for MakeIne to begin with.

And boy did A-1 Pictures bring out their SSS-rank Kaguya-sama explosive energy to give MakeIne the same treatment that the prior series received over 5 years ago, inciting the series as the spiritual successor to the franchise when it comes to the mayhem that is a production powerhouse. Under the leadership of storyboarder Shotaro Kitamura, which MakeIne would serve as his directorial debut after being trained in countless shows as both storyboarder and episode director (the most notables being last Fall's Overtake! and some episodes of Kusuriya no Hitorigoto a.k.a The Apothecary Diaries), you can feel the heated amounts of passion, talent, and drive being put into the anime to display at a pristine, almost movie-like quality that's matched by similar contemporaries alike. It just feels great to finally see A-1 Pictures flesh out more than just their animation prowess of the last few years being dedicated to action but romance certainly was not on the Bingo cards when considering the Aniplex-backed studio, not until the anime adaptation was announced to much fanfare. This show is absolute anime cinema quality through and through.

Music composer Kana Utahane leads the music department of MakeIne, and despite her rather limited rookie experience working on shows like Overtake! and Dead Mount Death Play, I thought that she did a great job on capturing the atmosphere and energy of the series to a T. But it's the OP and EDs that truly capture the Unlimited Budget Works of creativity put into it, with another song from Botchi Boromaru feat. Mossa of Necry Talkie's ""Tsuyogaru Girl"" being one of the absolute gems of a upbeat OP song that has all the bells and whistles executed to perfection. The various cover songs for the 3 girls acting as the EDs of their storylines, tells a lot about each and every girl's temperament that you can associate with what's to come for the series. Need I ever mention that they're all great, especially the OP which is just a visual masterpiece?

Why need a harem of girls, or one girl that can be the harem...when you can be part of a harem of friend-zoned losing heroines that you need not be forced to choose one or the other, let them have their way with you, and still make it out of a loving friendship being fellow dumpees? This is the magic of Make Heroine ga Oosugiru! a.k.a Too Many Losing Heroines!, a subversion and reinvention of the rom-com genre, and a real standout as THE BEST rom-com and Anime of the Season, if not for the entirety of 2024 alone. From the book's deeply-written characters to the anime's masterpiece execution of a production, everything is downright flawless, and you'd be damned to think that a show like this get all the hype for all the right reasons, when the anime has proven time and time again that tropes may be there for a reason, but when done correctly, can be strong, supporting, and defining elements to add to the quality of the overall work.

Nuff said, MakeIne's the undisputed anime of the Summer 2024 season and year material, bar none."
57524,539530.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Makeine is a testament to good directing, the visuals are constantly interesting and colorful, and the voice acting is unique and makes you love the characters even more. The directing of every facet of this anime is expertly done and that doesn’t go unnoticed. Also, unlike a lot of other shounen romcoms (ahem, Roshidere) it’s not a fantasy with some genius MC who gets all the girls. Nukumizu is very awkward, and he makes plenty of mistakes. But with each mistake he learns and gains the respect of those around him. When he steps over the line he gets chewed out, and that’s something that alot of romcoms fail to do. A main character that can do no wrong isn’t interesting and Makeine realizes this.

Finally, another thing I really love is that the characters actually seem like friends! It’s a detail that is so often neglected, but all of the main female characters seem like legitimate friends and they are believable as such. It makes rooting for all of them much easier, and the watching experience much more enjoyable.

So, is Makeine perfect? No. But, if you’re looking for a fun romcom that is both engaging and consistent I can’t recommend it enough."

57524,538764.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"TV shows these days won't stop making anime related to the rom-com genre any time soon. Whether it's about childhood romances, school crushes, or workplace love, there's seemingly always one or two that pops up every season. Makeine Too Many Losing Heroines didn't seem too different from the usual suspects but offers a somewhat unique take on the rom-com genre. Makeine: Too Many Losing Heroines! is connected by its genre, something that can't escape from since its first episode. It doesn't take long for us to discover why the heroines are known for 'losing'. Humans emotions are complex and there are countless ways to describe howwe feel each day. For the female cast of this show, they are connected by heart break. The anime intentionally sets up for them to be crushed mentally when their love interest rejects them. In some ways, the anime is self aware of its boundaries and what it set to do. At the center of it, a young man named Kazuhiko Nukumizu is confronted by these losing heroines.

Nukumizu represents the poster child of an introvert in this anime. Not the type to make friends easily and also keeping to himself, very few understands the type of person Nukumizu really is. In actuality, he is a normal teenager who just has self doubts especially when dealing members of the opposite sex. Furthermore, his otaku habits blends in with his real life behavior, such that he believes he sometimes believes life is like a light novel.

The show is created with romance in mind but not the typical 'guy and girl fall in love' together. The s main protagonist is actively aware of romance but his own inferiority causes him to have a low self-esteem. It doesn't take long for him to find others who also suffers from love and rejection. The most prominent among them includes Tsuwabuki High's first year student Anna Yanami. The pair's bonding begins after Anna got rejected by her crush and she needed a shoulder to confide in. Nukumizu becomes a sort of life coach for her even though he lacks any experience in romance. However, that's not the point. It's obvious that the anime wanted to build on their own relationship while also getting Nukumizu to grow out of his shell. From early episodes, he also makes contact with other heroines such as Lemon and Chika. Although their circumstances are different, they all fall in the category of being on the 'losing' when it comes to romance.

As self aware this anime is about romance, it doesn't necessary try to push that direction at every chance it gets. It treats the story narrative like a life lesson, as something that needs to be learned. Characters such as Anna, Lemon, and Chika all go through phases that resembles the 5 stage of grief. This is where Nukumizu's role plays in and he attempts to support them on an emotional level. It starts off awkwardly beause he has a hard time understanding each of their feelings. Given his poor social skills, Nukumizu's experience here almost feels like a lesson for him to learn too. Watching him pair up with the loser heroines invokes a variety of feelings and emotions. While he offers dating advice every now and there, it often has mixed results. By the time half this show aired, all the main girls has suffered emotionally in one way or another. None of them find their fairy tale ending and it begs brings the question whether Nukumizu failed as an advisor and as a friend.

Whatever direction you see the story dives into, it's obvious that it's also about the characters growing up. Romance and relationship plays into a big factor as part of the show's core themes. However, be aware that some of the main characters will take the 'Third Wheel' role, including Anna. Nukzumizu is also often caught in the middle of misunderstandings. And because of how the heroines are introduced to him in the show, it leaves Nukumizu a negative first impression of them. Ultimately, this show takes on an experimental like style of storytelling where it doesn't try to pair up the main guy with the three main girls. It uses him as a plot device while deconstructing the romance aspects and sticking to its main roots.

A-1 Pictures' style seems it was destined to adapt this light novel straight on the TV screen. Character designs looks just like the art illustration coming to life. The main girls each have their delicate features matched by their personalities. At times, there are also various comedic moments that looks foolishly cartoony. Other times, it gets emotional carried by tears, moans, and sobbing. And to add some flavor to the anime, the show promoted various artwork that you'd often find in romance. The ED theme songs are also colorful, catchy, and plays a metaphoric role in highlighting the studio's talents.

Makeine Too Many Losing Heroines! is a show that takes the romance genre and plays around with it almost like a game. Nukzumizu is forced to be in that role of a player who has to guide the losers to their victory. No, this isn't a show about love conquest. Instead, it's a life journey, a show that tests each of the characters' human feelings and see where it takes them."

57524,538762.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Romance anime are a dime a dozen these days, just like isekai, and many ideas have been used before, leaving little room for something to break the mold. So, count me surprised when I laid my eyes on Makeine: Too Many Losing Heroines!, where it took your common romance tropes and used them tastefully to craft an interesting take on the romance genre, which could be the next romance classic, especially if the anime adaptation continues. We’ve seen too many times, where the bland male protagonist, whether quiet, shy, or simply a loser, ends up having the most well-known girl in school falling head over heelsfor him for whatever reason. Here, the male protagonist, Kazuhiko Nukumizu, is by all accounts, also “bland”, introverted, and relegated to a background mob character role. The difference lies in the first moments, where he witnesses one of his female classmates being rejected, and sees her hilarious coping mechanisms afterwards.

However, that enough might not seem too convincing, because even something like that could be a precursor to the female classmate to fall for the male protagonist, but that is not the case, as each of these possible “romantic” moments are handled tastefully to give us a laugh, to the point where later on in the anime, you can even see the punchline coming.

The real theme of the story though, is not simply about a conventional romance, but it is initially about an observer’s view of romance trainwrecks in his school, with each heroine losing their battle with love. Through these experiences, we can see the theme of interpersonal communication in play, or lack thereof in some cases, which led to failures in the romantic escapades of the observer’s female classmates. In witnessing all these trainwrecks unfold, he in turn, also interacts with his classmates, who are all part of the Literature Club, and applies what he has learned through watching the rejections of his female classmates, and is able to not only make meaningful friendships, but also to mediate the various disputes or disagreements between others.

The thing I enjoyed the most about this anime was that it felt like high school all over again for me. As I have grown up a little from those school days, it was easy to laugh at the romance failures, and laugh at the stupidity of some of the characters, but as they say, teenagers are young and dumb, and that’s okay, we have all been there. The anime deals with interpersonal communication very well, because that is probably the most important thing that students have to learn, how to deal with other people. In romance, that is also likely the most important factor to a relationship. If one likes another, they have to tell them before it is too late. If one is rejected, how do they interact with the person that they got rejected by, and moreover, how do they interact with the person they lost to? When we got answers to these questions, that’s where we saw the growth of all the losing heroines, and how the Literature Club was able to stay afloat, despite all this drama. 

Now, the drama’s great and all, but the comedy was just as great, and here is where the staff I think went above and beyond, especially with their comedic timing, and the nature of the jokes. They were not afraid to step into some weird territory, such as extreme BL jokes, tasteful fan service gags, or some not-so-subtle sexual jokes, which had me howling in laughter sometimes. If you’ve seen the Twitter account and the website for this anime, you would know how much they care about some really random stuff, for example, like Anna, one of the main female protagonists, and how many calories she eats per episode. It’s in these little things that I could tell that the staff had a lot of fun even in their hard work, and that is always a sign of a good anime, when everyone working on it can have a good time.

With passionate staff, comes great production quality, at least most of the time, and here, it was one of the best animated things I have seen this season, and maybe even the year. It’s not just from a purely animation standpoint either, but the framing, cinematography, lighting, all of those aspects were excellent. As well, in one of the ending themes, the staff went so far as to getting rigs outside to create that real life camerawork that was there. Always like to see the extra effort.

A complaint I do see sometimes about this show is that there isn’t enough romance, but I’m honestly glad that was the case. I can’t speak to what happens later on in the story, but seeing the main character stay friends with his female classmates I think fit the mood of the show much more than forcing him to end with one of the losing heroines. The relationships build naturally, the dialogue gets more natural and the characters play off each other better and better as the anime goes along, which was very enjoyable. To anyone that has not seen this show, that is something to take note of, that it’s less of a conventional romance show between the main character and the other characters, but more a show that features romance as a side dish, at least for me, because the comedy and sometimes the drama were the things that I enjoyed the most out of everything. Is every arc seamless? No, but it handles a lot of its topics and themes with a lot of care, and most importantly, the developments feel earned.

There are many trainwrecks that we don’t want to look away from in the anime sphere, but here, I can happily say, it is one of the best trainwrecks I have laid my eyes on. One of the best anime of the year for me, and was a great A-1 Pictures passion project. See what they can do when they work on romance anime?

Now, excuse me as it is time for a midnight snack. What do you mean it’s not good for you? Anna Yanami told me that ice cream doesn’t make me fat…"
57524,539868.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"It Begins well, but as the anime progresses, nothing happens, they keep edging us to make us think that something is going to actually happen, but nothing happens. The final episode is terrible, the true ending is at episode 11, episode 12 feels like a filler episode. There are still moments where the anime is fun, generally where we think that its actually going to develop into something. So basically the first half is really good, but the second half loses completelly the pace of everything. With all of that in mind, you can still have fun watching it, in the end that's what matters."
57524,538831.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"It's far too early yet to declare this the best anime romcom, but it certainly has more than a shot at dethroning the likes of series like Kaguya-sama. What makes that interesting is that this series seems very much unwilling to tread the same path as its forebears. Maybe this will change (I hope it doesn't), but unlike FruBa, Kimi ni Todoke and Komi Can't Communicate, the series seems to distance itself from the usual pools of winners and losers. Oh sure, there are relationships that form and seem successful enough, but that's a territory occupied by side characters who aren't the focus of thistale. Meanwhile, for our leads, it always seems to linger just outside their grasp... some further than others.

I was drawn to this series early by the visuals and its humor, both of which kicked off strong in its first episode. I figured that would probably be the majority of the experience, just enjoying some ridiculous romcom scenarios with characters who are dealing with their ""loser heroine"" status badly - a good time, but nothing too special. And, yeah, there's some of that. There was a particularly groan-worthy scene in a shed in episode 2 that I chart as my only substantial down point of the season; it's the kind of inclusion I'd expect from a bargain bin high school romance anime and it doesn't go anywhere substantial by the end of the episode.

Thankfully, the series does move on, and in a big way. It takes the time to really delve into its three female leads, though some more than others. 

Chika, in particular, gets to spend a lot of this season in the spotlight and much for the better. She even gets the biggest moment to shine in the penultimate episode, which certainly felt like a finale (yes, I know the final episode was anime original - I don't really mind, but it certainly wasn't as good). Her attempts at romance, her feelings of isolation, and her desire to prove themselves all come across strongly as does her cheeky sense of humor, and she easily stands out as one of my favorite characters of the season. 

Lemon gets a set of episodes to be proud of, presenting very differently as someone who appears to have a lot of confidence and puts on a brave face, but is in the end just as awkward as the rest of them. One of the cringiest moments involves Lemon saying something off-handedly without realizing it, but Lemon faces moments like this to the best of her ability and refuses to get dragged down by these incidents. Also, yes, she really loves showing off that body.

Even with both of them, though, no one ends up outshining Anna. She gets many of the funniest moments as a result of her attempts at romance and friendships, and watching her not-so-silently fume at being stuck in the middle is just amazing. She has a lot of knowledge of relationships, but can never seem to apply them to herself, and her interplay with Kazuhiko throughout the series is priceless. I get that they want to foster a ""will they, won't they"" dynamic between these two, but I kinda love them as friends rather than romantic partners. She also has a couple of powerful scenes of her own, even if they don't beat out the best of the other two.

And yes, Kazuhiko's a good time, though I wish we got a little more insight into him over the course of the series. Most of what we get is from his sister Kaju, who at least should be contention for best imouto due to all she does (mostly just attempts to do) for her brother.

And then there's the side cast. Yumeko's great - every time she's on screen, she seems to bring a horror movie vibe with her completely by accident and it's amazing. I love their teacher Konami who is always going through some shit very loudly in her classes, easily the most relatable character in the show. Sayo is... a big old creeper playing out her fantasies with her kids... yeah, change her into a guy and this starts to look a lot worse. To varying extents, others made an impression as they played major and minor roles in the lives of our central tetrad.

All this is to say this was a great series. I think it was at its best when it wasn't playing into genre tropes, which were more common than I'd like, but it shines in virtually every other manner with excellent characters, great character arcs, and a vibe that kept me hungry for more."
57524,538864.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"This had a strong start, thanks to an interesting premise, strong animation, and exceptionally good direction and editing. The early episodes were also solid 8/10 material with a good combination of comedy and romantic drama. The problem is when it started giving multi-episode story arcs to each girl, which is when it becomes apparent that each is more tedious than the last. When it reached an entire episode about a stuttering girl's attempts to read out a few sentences in front of a dozen people, I found myself wondering, ""Why is this the story?"" As the series goes on, it leans ever more heavily onits strong production values to carry it, with some scenes carrying a strong visual impact, only to end with no indication of why that scene even needed to exist.

The other main problem with the show is how often it pushes the trope of all the girls insulting and belittling the cardboard male protagonist who does nothing but help them. Frankly I finished this series understanding why these girls were kicked to the curb. With the possible exception of Lemon, their personalities are lousy. That's successfully played for laughs in Anna's case, but equally often just leaves a poor impression of them as people."
57524,539066.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"A little-explored topic within the romance genre, unresolved feelings. Nostalgia, remorse, regret, unrequited love, emotional grief and friendships to heal the pain of a broken heart. Makeine is a work that is appreciated more the further away you are from your school days. Depending on which side of the situation you were on in your school life, you can feel empathy with rejected girls or you can understand the pain of a person you rejected. School life goes by so fast that we never stopped to reflect on our actions and now as adults who have a little more emotional maturity is that we can understandthese types of situations.

As for the work, the best thing about it are its characters. We have 3 heroines who are totally different from each other but who complement each other very well as friends. Each of them will deal with their pain in a totally different way. Our protagonist, personally, is the best thing about the work. It is an archetype of character that is rarely used within the genre. A character focused on passive listening. Nukumizu will always be indirectly involved in the rejection of each of the girls and although he will try to help them, he will never try to impose his will or force them to overcome it. Nukumizu will only be there to listen to them, to let them vent and in this way allow us to understand all the overwhelming emotions that the girls have in their hearts. This causes the girls to reach a conclusion by themselves, thanks to the fact that they had someone who would listen to them. Many times we give little value to someone listening to us, but most of the time that is all we need. We don't need advice, we don't need them to try to solve our problems, we just need them to lend us a shoulder for a moment.

I know I'm getting too reflective in this review, but this was one of those anime where I never stopped thinking and analyzing too many things at the end of each chapter. Still, to relax a bit, we must add that the comedy is quite effective. I think that many times they use the concept of ""my traumas, my jokes"" very well, sometimes making us laugh uncomfortably. In the animation, A-1 honestly surprised me for the better. He treated this anime as if it were made of porcelain. He paid attention to every detail, which sometimes makes you doubt that it is the same A-1 that we know. I must also emphasize that even though the last chapter of the anime was an original idea, it did not clash with the canon of the story. The influence and participation of the author in this last chapter is very noticeable. It is appreciated that it was not one of those filler chapters where the studio takes enough creative freedom to ruin the experience.

In the end, Makeine took me back to the times of my school life. It made me reflect on the times I was rejected, on the times I rejected someone else, but above all it made me value how fleeting relationships can be. I appreciate finding stories that try to contribute something new, a different perspective, but above all I appreciate a story that makes me remember memories that I had forgotten."
57524,538854.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Having already written a review before finishing the series, i am happy to say that it has gone up to a straight 10/10 for me. A-1 has really blessed us with the two best romcoms of recent memory in my opinion Kaguya-Sama being number 1 and Makeine coming in at a close number 2 (with the disadvantage of only having one season SO FAR) Makeine is a show about people, about people with faults and dreams and romantic interests, about how those people handle the loss of the people they love in a romantic way. It's youth and the first thing we see the MC say is""Most High-School Relationships end once the couple graduates"" and that same person grows in the series to change his views, never have i seen an MC where he is at fault many times and has to grow to help others, usually the MC is a self insert and they have to gratify that they are always correct because you want the audience to think that they're perfect and everyone else is at fault.

Nukumizu as a character spits on that idea, you are not perfect, you can grow and as you grow you'll be appretiated. It's something unique that i don't even think Kaguya-Sama had with Miyuki.

The cast feel like friends and not fake characters who get along beacuse the plot needs them to, they each have their own reason for making that bond with one another and our mc. 

At the end i wanna say that while it's hard to imagine, you too can go live that sort of life, grow, reach out and make bonds. That is what the anime is truly about, finding your own faults and working towards them.

That is special, like this series

I wish another season gets animated and if not, then this will be my first LN. Thank you Nukumizu, Anna, Lemon, and Chika

And thank you to A-1 for creating a gorgeous show and one that can change lives like this"
57524,540101.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"""Makeine-Toooooo Many Losing Heroines"" Truly captures the essence of what makes a good slice-of-life, rom-com anime shine. It reminds me so much of Oregairu in the best possible ways, blending witty dialogue, nuanced character relationships, and that familiar mix of humor and heartfelt emotion. The protagonist in Makeine feels like a perfect blend of relatable awkwardness and sharp introspection, much like Hachiman from Oregairu. The inner monologues, the subtle social dynamics, and the way characters grow and connect felt both nostalgic and refreshing. Every interaction carries weight, yet the series maintains a light, enjoyable tone throughout. What I loved the most was the character development, especially howthe anime explores the more subtle, awkward emotions of high school life. The humor is spot-on, balancing out the more tender moments, and the love triangle (or perhaps square) keeps you on your toes without feeling overdone. Each character has depth and personality, which makes you root for all of them in different ways.

The animation is crisp, and the art style complements the show's tone perfectly. Plus, the soundtrack sets the mood beautifully, adding to the overall charm of each scene.

Overall, Makeine is a gem for fans of Oregairu or anyone who enjoys thoughtful, character-driven stories. I loved it so much and give it a perfect 10/10 for its mix of humor, heart, and nostalgic vibes."
57524,538793.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Imagine yourself, 16 years old, in high school, there’s that boy or girl that you have always had a crush on since you were 5 years old but you were too shy to confess your feelings.You really really like them. All of a sudden you get a second wind, that little sprinkle of confidence. You decide on a whim to confess your deep feelings to your crush today. Deep breath you got this. Nothing can go wrong, right? You finally ask them out on a sunny day. To your surprise and elation they say yes! You both hug it out and in the heat of themoment you both lean in for a kiss and…

BEEP BEEP BEEP!!!!

It's the sound of your alarm clock ringing. You awake from your dream. Reality is often disappointing. Turns out they rejected you straight up and never had any feelings for you because it turns out they liked your other cooler/cuter friend. RIP…

You put up a face at school but when you get home to your room, the tears start flowing and you cry yourself to sleep. Then as you slumber away you dream of the ideal reality where you go out with your crush as a coping mechanism. You poor little thing. When you wake up the next morning, at 3 PM, you slowly get up and rub your swollen water filled eyes and try to move on with your day and your life with your broken heart. Sound familiar?

If this situation rings true to your heart you either are an average adolescent like the rest of us were or you’re a female heroine in the summer comedy romance title; Makeine: Too Many Losing Heroines!

In this glorious romantic comedy about high school rejections, we start off with our MC, our main boy and broken heart therapist Nukumizu as he somehow gets dragged in protagonist style into the lives of three newly brokenhearted high school girls. He’s the quiet introverted type who wants to be out of the spotlight, but with the magical power and plot armor of the main character he is our fated one tasked to console not just one, not two, but three of his highschool mates from the horror of post rejection. Yes, he was there to experience THREE WHOLE rejections in THREE different circumstances. This would be like going to Las Vegas, Reno, and Atlantic City to gamble three different times and then getting blackjack all three times. Wow すごい。

Yes, instead of your typical rom-com where we focus on the MC and his love interests until they ultimately get together as a couple, Makeine shows us the perspective of the losers. The brokenhearted, rejected, saddened love interests. Yes we’re talking about the Yui’s from Oregairu, the Miku’s and Nino’s from Quinquennial Quintuplets, the Onodera’s from Nisekoi. Don’t mean to rub the salt in the wound, I injected it. 😛  

That’s the whole point of this show. It focuses on the losing aspect of every romantic comedy and trope there is. It’s different , it’s refreshing, it’s entertaining and that’s why it’s great. At the end of every rom com after the main character and their destined partner get together, have you ever thought about the other characters who sacrificed their emotional stability to confess for the chance of love. Have you ever wanted to see the weeks and months of personal growth or sadness as a result of unrequited love? Have you ever wanted to cheer for your favorite character’s post-confession life and ship them with a new character?

If all these criteria match your interests, well… 

Now you can drop Isekai Suicide Sauad and watch Makeine: Too Many Losing Heroines! from the goated studio A-1 Pictures. They did a really good job with this one. So, it’s an 9 out of 10 for me."
57524,538940.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I'll try to keep this short and to the point. Pros: - Beautiful, movie-level animation - Excellent VA work - A somewhat fresh take on the subject of high-school romantic comedies, showing us a point of view we've haven't seen much before - Loveable, unconventional heroines (in a good way) - Does not reduce people, including romantic rivals to clichés, almost everyone of significance is portrayed as a complex (if not necessarily realistic) character - Despite the MC's somewhat depressing worldview and narration, the overall message of the show feels positive and uplifting, demonstrating how people can find happiness and friendship even in emotionally trying times.Cons:
- While it tackles subjects related to romantic comedies, it does not really feel like one. (Though this might not be a bad thing, depending on one's preferences.) The titular losing heroines spend more time recovering from their rejections than looking for anyone new.
- The three heroines don't get equal amounts of screen time and development. Komari is my favorite of the three, but I still feel her arc was one episode longer than it needed to be. In contrast, Anna's character felt painfully underdeveloped overall.
- Character development itself is a hit-and-miss, feeling like smoke and mirrors at times. We definitely see the three girls taking important steps in their lives, but the exact changes in their outlook can be hard to pin down.
- Not the worst, but also certainly not the best ever male lead: he's no self-insert or pathetic doormat, but his own complexes and pessimism can make him feel annoying or worse still, stubborn in his foolishness at times, despite his good intentions.
- The usual light novel adaptation curse: the show does not really get to any meaningful conclusion, it simply ends. Future seasons (here's hoping) might rectify this problem along with a few mentioned above.

I'm a nitpicker, so of course I wrote more about the cons than the pros, but make no mistake: if the above leaves you on the fence, I wholeheartedly recommend giving this series a try."
57524,539384.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Makeine is easily one of the best animes this season, though honestly not something I would put as Anime of the Year. A lot was done extremely well with the show, but some aspects were lacking that made me less inclined to keep watching weekly and just wait to binge watch it. Much like many MANY other A-1 shows, it peaks at the first couple episodes and slowly decays throughout the season till the last episode. You can tell most of the focus was on the introductory arcs of the ""Losing Heroines"" as these are actually some of the most beautifully scripted scenes in entertainment asa while. So much care and nuance is put into the each aspect of their introductions you get a strong understanding of who they are as characters and how they each uniquely fit into the world despite essentially being tropes of harem characters. Despite seemingly being characters you could find in any other trashy harem show, each heroine has distinct character and humanity that makes you really feel like they're working through a history that happened off-screen and we are now seeing the climax of their unrequited romances and the aftermath.

A lot of this anime is ""show, don't tell"" with shots lingering on something important in the environment or an action a character takes without explaining it or making comments. Putting it on the viewer to figure it out and come to their own conclusions makes the world and characters feel alive, because much like real life, not everything needs to be said out loud for you to understand what is happening.

As for the character arcs, they were good. I wouldn't say they were blow you away or leave a deep impression, but they were very solid and delivered on everything the show promised from the start. I won't even say it's a negative since it really does depict the everyday drama of high school life and anxiety fairly well with some scenes feeling like they were probably ripped from the writer's past experiences.

Overall I'd say this is worth the watch even if only to see what good storytelling and character writing looks like. 

8 out of 10.

TL;DR - Good show, very solid rom-com with some deep cuts. Highly recommend if that's your thing."
57524,539035.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I surprisingly quite enjoyed this one, not my usual forte but the characters in this really help it pull through for me. It's a usual kind of romcom but its got its own differences that make it worth watching. The animation in this is really good and really helps the lowkey yet really nice character designs pop, they're not over designed or anything yet they're all unique and well designed. All the girls have different personalities while also not falling too hard into the typical stereotypes we get for these kinds of anime. Quickly grew to the anime I was most excited to put onfor this season just because of how fun it was."
57524,538965.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"This isn't a typical romance anime. Instead of get-togethers, it's centered around break-ups and dealing with lost love. In this case, 3 girls who have had a long-standing crush on someone now seeing them go out with someone else and having to deal with that pain. Hence the title 'Too Many Losing Heroines'. Throw in an MC with a background-character type of presence with no experience in the topic, and it makes for an interesting dynamic. Makeine isn't a harem though. It's centered around building platonic relationships between the MC Nukumizu and the 3 girls who have been recently heartbroken. Each character has been developed throughthis premise of coming to terms with their situations. The way they think is equivalent to that of a traditional high schooler but in a more complex manner. Komari had the longest arc of the 3 and it really showed the nuances of her character, her inner feelings and social awkwardness, yet she maintains a drive for self-improvement in a lot of areas, including being more outgoing. Lemon and Anna on the other hand are both very bright characters but deep down they have their own insecurities that they must deal with.

If you're looking for romance throughout the show though, you're mistaken. Like I said before, the show is surrounded by the formation of a platonic friend group between Anna, Lemon, Komari, and Nukumizu. I would totally recommend it though because this anime is relatable, reminiscent of my own past struggles."
57524,538958.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"*Minor Spoilers* Lemme preface this review by saying Oregairu/My Youth Romantic Comedy Is Wrong, as I Expected is my favorite anime. Not only was the series just really nicely written with some very complex and emotional romance and comedy, I watched it during a personally dark time where the series was really relatable to my insecurities and issues that luckily have improved since I watched it a couple years ago. Makeine: Too Many Losing Heroines! was giving me plenty of Oregairu vibes throughout it's run, and it was one of the few series this season that I was looking forward to episodes for every week. Mylove for Oregairu definitely influenced this review a little bit.

From the visual standpoint, A1 Pictures always has great animation and character design. This series is no exception. The animation feels very fluid and real, and it offers some really pretty views and settings for the more artistic viewers. The character design and their character traits/personality really match with what the anime is trying to portray: a hodgepodge of oddballs and misfits, ultimately brought together by failing relationships. This season was mainly split into two arcs, one involving Lemon and the other involving Komari. I much liked the stories being told. Lemon's was more of a story of the failing romance, while Komari's was more of tale of self growth, and I could really feel the emotions they were feeling as characters. The main oddball of this series is Yanami, who is realistically the main heroine. I really liked Yanami and Nukumizu's platonic relationship throughout the series, it felt less like a harem and more natural feeling even with 3 girls at the writer's disposal. Speaking of Nukumizu, I have seen previous reviews for this series' source material stating they felt his character growth was lackluster, and I definitely disagree with that for the anime at least. It it not as profound as the girls, but he definitely becomes much more round as he experiences what he does through out the season, and I actually rather enjoyed his character.

I will say for the people who enjoy straightforward romance anime, this really isn't the show for you. There is certainly a lot more character building taking place in this season, and there isn't a whole much happening with the main character's intimate relationship with his troupe. I, however, enjoy this kind of romance anime more so than more straightforward ones (think Alya, from this season as well). Circling back to my love for Oregairu, this show just me the vibe again that I got from my beloved series. It is really hard to describe into words exactly what I'm feeling, but Makeine gave me that same cozy, comfy vibe that I did when I rewatch Oregairu. I surmise it's mainly due to the misfit characters, setting, and romance this show harbors. It's missing the relatability and the timing Oregairu had for me, but that's no fault to give the series.

Makeine: Too Many Losing Heriones! was my favorite series for the Summer 2024 season. I really enjoyed the characters and the story, and I am rather excited to see if a second season materializes."
52367,538238.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"No Longer Allowed In Another World - No Longer Human, Isekai version? Yes and Amen to death. Let's just admit this one sole fact: Isekai is just getting boring with each iteration of new seasonal shows with the same wash, rinse, repeat shtick, that one look and you'll be right to give it a miss that you won't forget to not come back. That works for about 90% of the time, but sometimes, there's shows that do have that same gimmick, but offers something else in return, and despite the negative connotations just from the title alone, the true meat of the story goes deep-diving intothe depths of the unknown that it is what makes the work so unique to begin with. This is Isekai Shikkaku a.k.a No Longer Allowed in Another World, written by mangaka Hiroshi Noda, whom you will also recognize as the author of Koi wa Sekai Seifuku no Ato de a.k. Love After World Domination, which received Project No. 9's anime adaptation back in Spring 2022. Despite both series being serialized at the exact same time, the latter ended its run back in November of that same year with the manga being axed for a rushed ending, while the former is still ongoing.

If you have read or seen Love After World Domination back in the day, I assume that you're already familiar with Hiroshi Noda having a signature of creating parody works of popular genres. And like with the former splicing both the superhero action with the rom-com genre, he has done it once again for Isekai Shikkaku, this time on the action adventure with the fantasy genre, by incorporating one of Japan's most iconic figures: Shuji Tsushima, better known otherwise as Osamu Dazai (yes, that Bungou Stray Dogs MC character name is also where the inspiration came from). Of course, while staying true to the roots of said novelist, even down to his death and the sequence of events that led to it, the parody maestro knows how to turn this into a compelling story: just nickname him as Sensei, retrace the roots of Dazai's lovers' pact of a double-suicide with his partner Tomie Yamazaki (who's only known as Sacchan), and add in the twist of Truck-kun for the iconic Isekai effect, and lay it all bare on the Other Worlder who finds himself literally in another world, but still hoping to die one day till he's fulfilled his tragic job. Until then, Sensei has to bear with the constant annoyances of the NPC announcer telling him that he's earned EXP, leveled up and the like that's usual with RPG elements, by being thwarted with inconvenient heroics that make him the ""tragic hero"" that he is, with an actual sense of purpose...?

It's obscenely clear that Dazai, or Sensei in this regard, his goal is just to ensue death by whatever means possible, because that's what his life's calling is glued to. But on the other hand, being in a fantasy world, meant that Saachan could also be in this world, and therefore he sets out on a tragic journey to find his lost partner. Where the problem for Sensei stems from, starts with the one who summoned him into said world: the elf priestess Annette, who implied that it was Truck-kun who did the work, and her just merely an NPC messenger to tell the summoners that they're the stereotypical heroes capable of defeating their world's Demon Lord. Of course, being so adamant about death, Sensei shrugs her off like nobody’s business and proceeds to wander into the fantasy world, trying to find a way to commit suicide. It’s then that he encounters a catgirl being captured by a monster, but being too occupied to die, Sensei easily succumbs to the monster, but his powers of bad luck saved both himself and her, and made him the hero that he did not want to be, thereby warranting her to follow him…at the cusp of just naming her Tama (i.e. cat in Japanese) and not wanting to know her real name any further.

Sensei’s quite the hilarious unexpected figure of evil who also unexpectedly does the work of good, especially with his “Death Note” diary that he uses to pen the lives of others, especially since he’s a writer by origin. And that diary from within, encloses his only ability: Storyteller, whom triggers all kinds of effects based on the person or people of notice to decide if they’re alright for the fantasy world, or as the series’ title suggests: No Longer Allowed in Another World, by sending them back to Earth for all the wrongs they’ve done in their lives, whom still have a heart to do things right, as their salvation. This is so because not only are there Other Worlders just like Sensei, but they’re too many of them to ever be counted to counter their villainous acts in the fantasy world, giving rise to the antagonist group known as the Fallen Angels: potential Other Worldly heroes who were once thought to be capable of defeating the Demon Lord, now turned to the dark side after said entity has been wiped out. And that’s the role of Annette and Tama as they join Sensei in finding Saachan, whom he thinks is also alive somewhere in the fantasy world, as this course of events winds down a deep, dark spiral, aside from the occasional comedy of the nonchalant writer who prefers to sleep in his designated bed of a worn-down coffin…that’s still another way to die. Always the determinator, Sensei, amidst the elf who turns out a lot more useful than she initially looks, as well as the catgirl whom despite her outbursts from ignorance, has an exact episode of her own with the Other Worlders. But still, the unlikely comrades create the perfect party for Sensei to find his partner-in-crime.

Is it too much of a coincidence to say that whenever studio AtelierPontdarc is, there will always be Isekai in the title? To be fair, outside of the short that is Ganbari Douki-chan, the newly established studio still has a lot of ways to go with animation and production values that can be mistaken for just about any B-tier studio in the mix. This is especially since the production-ridden Summer 2022 show of Isekai Ojisan a.k.a Uncle from Another World that’s still being fresh in our minds, despite its uniqueness (most of which was adapted from the manga of the same name), and with Isekai Shikkaku being just the studio’s 2nd work ever done, it’s alright, but nothing noteworthy.

The music…there could be more of it, because most portions of the anime just felt empty at times, and even more considering that it’s music composer Kenichiro Suehiro, the same composer as Isekai Ojisan, which that show had more value added to it. Aside from that, I thought that Kashitaro Ito’s OP was a little off kilter for my liking, but it’s still a quality song through and through. The dissonance thereafter with Mayu Maeshima’s ED, she just knows how to nail shows with dark post-atmospheric feelings, and I felt the song with the lingering of my skin to a solemn degree of good.

The misadventures of Osamu Dazai in No Longer Human, or rather, mangaka Hiroshi Noda’s take by displaying a parody of it, I have once trusted in Koi wa Sekai Seifuku no Ato de a.k.a Love After World Domination before, and Isekai Shikkaku a.k.a No Longer Allowed in Another World, continues the trend that the author himself knows what he’s doing to deliver a parody that as serious as it comes, there’s comedy to be had as well. It may not look like the innovative thing considering the AniManga of recent times, but it’s still a solid show that while it teaches about the tales of wisdom of the famed novelist himself, the story doesn't slow down to allow its characters to shine being a psudeonym of the real life from the perspective of adults.

If parody's your thing, Isekai Shikkaku's a no-frills recommendation as a comedy relief show. Either be condemned and humbled to receive salvation or be consumed by greed and ego to sink deep into the abyss."
52367,538253.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I almost did not watch this anime but I got bored and gave it a chance and I'm glad I did. It's a little different than other isekai in that the main character has a more melancholic tendency than the average and the people of the world he's transported into don't quite know what to do with him at first. The characters were likeable but in the first few episodes they were a little forgettable, but came into their own as the story played out. The narrative also had this trouble a little too but once it found its footing, I looked forward to watchingeach new episode. I liked it enough in the end that I hope we get more episodes because I'm definitely willing to continue watching and seeing where this story takes everyone next. 

If you like isekai and don't mind suicidal characters, then you might like this. If you don't like suicidal idealization then you will want to skip this one."
52367,539561.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"A refreshing take on isekai-genre. Still your classic isekai in every way, but with some twists. Main character Sensei really hard carries this show. Most unique isekai main protag I've seen in a while. Definitely not impressive or anything like that in terms of production quality, just a plain old middle of the road isekai. But very refreshing, which is most important to me in a bloated genre like this. If you cannot enjoy sensei and his antics, then this show probably isn't for you. If you can get a chuckle out of some of the things sensei does, then this show is foryou. You should know if it's for you after about the first three episodes."
52367,538237.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"This one is a mixed bag for me. On one hand it surely didn’t follow the usual isekai routine with a bland MC that has zero traits and personality, on the other - it still plays really safe and doesn’t stand out too much. Now let me give you a bit more details. World/story. An isekai world mass imported unhappy broken people to wage their war only to find out that unhappy broken people can easily go rogue, so someone now needs to solve this new problem. I will not lie that while the whole mass transportation isn’t a new concept, a twist with rogue heroesplays pretty good here, at least because I haven’t seen it used for a while now. Just don’t expect the rest of the world to have a unique twist, as it mostly is the usual isekai stuff.
Characters. Finally we have a main character who isn’t a self-insert. A very depressed suicidal writer is indeed a rather unusual hero for a story. Sadly him being an author and suicidal is just a reason to go for a few dark humour jokes, and those ones aren’t really good. Even though I do like dark jokes, those ones are playing… kinda safe? They are the easiest, the most obvious and the most tame jokes you could use in that situation and while some of them managed to make me smile a bit none of them made me laugh, as if it either didn’t land or didn’t hit hard enough. So while we finally have an interesting hero, not much interesting stuff is happening to him. For a secondary cast we got a more standard set of heroes. They have their growth, they have their moments, but those heroes lack the unusualness of the MC so they are rather basic. Villains are mainly of a “misunderstood/mistreated” type, and while the whole concept gets predictable very fast it is still executed on a good enough level to be passable. 
Production: well, it isn’t bad. Loved the ending, didn’t notice BGM, VA all did a good job and the visuals are fine - nothing stellar though, as there isn’t really much action to be honest.

Summary. So, did I enjoy the show? A bit but yeah, I did. Can I recommend it? Not really, cause, to be honest, I don’t think there is enough stuff put in it to be worth a recommendation. To put it in another way: this title would be good if it focused more on all the unusual twists it makes, but in its current state it is just another isekai with a few small differences that elevate it from mass produced boring garbage but not enough to leave the “mediocrity zone”."
52367,538562.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I'll keep this one short and sweet. In the turbid pool of formulaic soulless garbage that we call the isekai genre, Isekai Shikkaku stands out as an above average, entertaining, well made isekai that has its own interesting gimmick. The protagonist, Sensei, is a powerless, grumpy, suicidal nihilist who doesn't give a single fuck most of the time and never takes part in fighting directly, this single detail on its own sets it apart from most other isekais. Despite being powerless, he does command respect and is viewed as a threat solely due to his bizarre outlook on life, concerningly low self preservation instincts, andmaturity shown in the most dire of situations. The show explores some pretty heavy themes, but it doesn't take itself seriously, which for better or for worse, just results in the show having its own brand of 'comedy'. The side characters are given some development, but stay one dimensional for the most part, the standard shit you have seen everywhere else. It's just a pretty solid isekai that felt like a breathe of fresh air. It deviates from the norm in a really interesting way, and I enjoyed it.

TLDR: Isekai Shikkaku is a show carried by a unique and refreshing MC, but commits the same sins many other subpar isekais do. Don't expect too much from it and I'm sure you will enjoy it for what its worth."
52367,538297.0,8.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"This is a ""what if a 90s depressed & suicidal grunge alt-rock artist (Kurt Cobain) was turned into an early 1900s anime protagonist"", which isn't a bad thing. ""No Longer Allowed in Another World"" is a really good anime with just a very slow start. The first few episodes take their merry time to speed up, but once the pace actually speeds up, it gets much better to watch. Lets start with whats good: 1. The Animation: The animation is very pleasing to the eyes and doesn't have jank CGI like some animes that were released this season. Really well produced and has very crisp animation. 2. The Characters: At firstI wasn't very sure of the characters, they came across as one dimensional in the beginning episodes, but as this season went on they gained an alright personality with ""Sensei"" actually getting decent development. By the time the anime ended I really liked the characters, obviously some of them are very basic, but they at-least were likable and didn't come across as stupid and dense.

3. The Story:
The story is actually pretty good, and isn't boring to watch. Though this isn't exactly the most original premise, it is done very well and has good plot twists and does some original stuff that isn't common in other animes. Some of it is predictable, but don't let it distract you from seeing that this has a fun story.

The bad:
1. First episodes are really slowly paced:
As I said prior this anime has a really slow pacing at the start of the anime. This isn't the most fun to watch through at the beginning and it is easy to see why a lot of people dropped this anime at episode 3 and didn't want to give the rest a shot.

2. Some of the humor isn't great:
This is something that is SUBJECTIVE, so please take it with a grain of salt. A decent amount of this anime's suicidal and dark jokes don't quite hit the mark of actually being funny, even when they are funny it is more because it is random, like the anime randomly panning over to the MC eating a bunch of poisonous pills to end themselves. Of course there are funny scenes here that do not involve the MC poisoning himself, but a good majority are involving his suicidal tendencies which can be a coin flip on if they are funny or not.

The ugly:
If you don't like a theme that involves suicide as a comedic joke, then this is probably not for you, and it should be ignored if you have the belief that suicide is not a joke or can be used as a joke.

If you want to watch something, and you don't want to search through anime on MAL for 3 hours for something to watch, this is pretty good and I recommend it.

52367,538236.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Isekai Shikkaku got overshadowed this season, but make no mistake, this is the BEST fantasy show of Summer 2024 by far. It came out of seemingly nowhere and delivered an extremely refreshing take on the isekai genre with mature writing and themes, focus on characters rather than your usual defeat the demon lord or revenge plot and a unique MC for once who doesn’t rely on overpowered abilities to win his battles. The emphasis on helping people move past their trauma and return to their original world was such an interesting narrative decision that made for quite a few emotional moments that I cried for.This might seem like seasonal isekai #520000 but it’s so much more and I had a great time watching.

So Isekai Shikkaku has a couple things going for it that make it really good. The first of which being the characters. The party dynamic is among the best I’ve ever seen in the medium. Dazai, Tama, Annette and Near form a genuine family as the show goes on and it doesn’t rely on the girls falling in love with Dazai or fanservice like you see in other fantasy shows. Instead, the unlikely bunch come together after Dazai helps each of them and establishes an almost teacher-student relationship with them. It’s such a cool and wholesome dynamic and I enjoyed seeing how much they all look up to him and how close they got on their travels. The other thing is Dazai himself. You know normally in these isekai shows we get an otaku loser who gets summoned to another world and gets a harem of hot girls around him, fights bad guys, levels up like it’s a video game etc., but isekai Shikkaku is the first isekai I’ve seen that has an actual historical figure as the main character. Yes, that’s right, THAT Dazai is the MC here and they incorporate a lot of his real life personality traits, particularly his desire to commit suicide. It’s played up as a gag a lot, but actually has some very big plot relevance and he’s able to connect with other characters they encounter as a result. Other isekai MCs are out here looking for glory as an adventurer and Dazai just wants to find his lover that he was isekai’d with and commit suicide together. 

The other thing that really made this a fun ride was the emphasis on establishing character relationships to stop bad guys rather than just overpowering them with strength. So Dazai does have some broken abilities, but he’s not a fighter. He’s a writer and the author actually did an amazing job of incorporating that into the story. Having Dazai write stories about the characters he’s dealing with and then let them finish it by sending them home, it’s a cool mechanic and speaks to the emotional intelligence of the author here. It almost has a precure vibe if that makes sense with how Dazai deals with villains here. He doesn’t break their bodies or beat them up, but instead breaks through to their hearts , understands where they went wrong and then gives them another chance at life by going back to earth with the lessons they’ve learnt. I know it sounds a little cheesy on paper, but in practice it’s so good and a lot of the characters have gone through some genuinely tough circumstances that when you see, you can’t help but cry over. It’s kind of easy to brush it off as being evil, but if you had all the power in the world after being abused or neglected in your previous life, a lot of people would be in the same position if you put them in this story.

So the story is great and I cried a few times, but the show also just looks gorgeous. I love the character designs and art style and it might not be the best animation but it’s good enough. Direction wise, there’s a couple episodes that were so well done and self contained they almost felt like films. Episode 1 and 11 come to mind. 

This is just a really good watch man and a breath of fresh air. I loved the characters, the interesting plot mechanics, Dazai constantly trying to off himself, the casket pulling, you name it. Simply put it’s a great anime and I highly recommend it. 

Isekai Shikkaku gets 9 caskets out of 10."
52367,539883.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"'No Longer Allowed in Another World' appears to be another generic isekai, but it's more than that. It's a parody of the isekai genre. § Overview The anime begins with Sensei, which is presumably Dazai Osamu, who is about to have a double suicide with his lover Sacchan. But before he can do so, truck-kun takes him to another world. He was summoned to defeat the evil lord, who unknown at that time was defeated earlier, but he would none of that. All he wants is to find Sacchan. Later on, he learns that other worlders like Sensei are wreaking havoc and are worse than the evillord. 


§ Strengths and Weaknesses

Since the protagonist is Dazai Osamu, many were disappointed with this anime. Maybe they were expecting too much from him. I think Dazai Osamu was only used so this anime could have a suicidal and nihilistic character. Speaking of which, it rubs me the wrong way that he is suicidal and nihilistic, but that's just me. YMMV.

He is an effective character given the context of what the show is trying to do, but overall he is unlikeable. Perhaps I have somewhat of a liking for him because his seiyuu also voices Araragi.

The animation is pretty average, and this anime doesn't really require devoting resources to improve the animation given the story. Truck-kun is used too much ad nauseam. 

It uses dark humour and I'm sure it's not everyone's cup of tea. It's unpleasant sometimes, but I do appreciate how it is trying to differentiate itself to other isekai. 

Speaking of which, this is in the same vein as that other isekai parody called 'My Instant Death Ability Is So Overpowered.' That one is pure comedy and can be fun. This one can sometimes be funny, but there are moments of drama.

It is not totally different though. Sensei attracts different women to become part of his harem, although he is not interested. Thus, some standard isekai tropes are used but executed differently.


§ Conclusion

This anime is a parody of the isekai genre. It uses dark humour that can be funny but sometimes unpleasant. Although it tries to be different, you can't help but feel it's an average story, and we're not even considering its unpleasant subtext."

52367,538649.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"This anime is a bit tricky to evaluate. It offers moments of genuine intrigue, but the overall package feels uneven, weighed down by some shallow elements that limit its potential. At its core, the premise plays with the familiar “what if Isekai tropes, but the main character is… different?” The protagonist, Sensei, a clear nod to Osamu Dazai, is thrust into the standard Isekai setup, summoned to another world and tasked with defeating the demon king. But unlike the typical hero, Sensei rejects the call to adventure, preferring instead to search for his lover Sacchan and chronicle the tragedies of those around him. This twiston the standard Isekai formula sets the stage for what could have been an insightful subversion of the genre. Yet, despite this interesting premise, the series never fully capitalizes on its potential.

While the idea of an anti hero refusing to save the world may seem fresh at first, it quickly becomes apparent that it isn’t as novel as the show seems to think. Sensei’s refusal to follow the heroic path has been done in other Isekai stories, and this anime doesn’t explore it in a way that feels particularly new or groundbreaking. It’s not a bad setup by any means, but the execution struggles to maintain momentum, particularly when the main character’s melancholic tendencies are played more as a recurring trope rather than something deeply meaningful.

That being said, there are glimpses of depth in Sensei’s character. His role as a writer who is fascinated by human suffering and tragedy adds layers beyond the typical “suicidal and nihilistic” persona. His desire to document the emotions and experiences of those he encounters hints at an underlying complexity that could have been explored more thoroughly. Unfortunately, the show’s shallow supporting cast often undermines these moments. Sensei’s journey largely revolves around fighting other Isekai adventurers, those who, after defeating the demon king, seek to seize power for themselves. These antagonists are cartoonish and one dimensional, making it difficult to feel invested in their conflicts or the world they inhabit.

Humor occasionally surfaces in the absurd interactions between Sensei and the world around him, but it’s not enough to save the show from its cast. The story only begins to show signs of life past the halfway mark, and even then, some of its attempts to introduce “gray morality” feel a bit clumsy and stilted. However, there are moments of genuine improvement towards the season's end, particularly with the final two Isekai adventurers the group confronts. These characters have more fleshed out backstories and motivations, adding some much needed texture to the narrative. Sensei’s unique ability to “record” their stories and offer them redemption by sending them back to their pre death lives on Earth provides a satisfying payoff. It’s in these moments that the show’s potential truly shines, exploring how people are changed by their experiences in this fantasy world, contemplating their regrets, and what it means to face their own mortality. This concept of redemption and reflection is where Isekai Shikkaku comes closest to realizing its thematic ambitions.

Ultimately, Isekai Shikkaku is a series that lives and dies by its characters and their stories. The uneven quality of the cast makes it hard to stay engaged initially, but there are interesting ideas buried beneath the surface. While the first half of the show is weighed down by shallow conflicts and repetitive character tropes, the latter half offers glimpses of the deeper narrative that could emerge in future seasons. If it can continue to develop its characters and lean into its darker, more introspective moments in the future, it may yet grow into something special."
52367,538328.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Maaaan what a banger of a show. If you're like me, you would have been both intrigued by the premise but also turned off because the concept of a suicidal main character in an isekai doesn't seem like much of a fun experience....and you and I would both be VERY wrong. The comedy hits every time, the animation is smooth and very appealing for the eyes, and the story is so damn good for an isekai it's actually insane. The backstories of the other worlders, the dialogue with Sensei and the others, the character development for the main character's crew, it all fits in sowell with everything. 

For a season of anime that I thought would be boring, there have seriously been a lot of unexpected hits rather than misses, and here's to hoping this trend continues.

52367,538792.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Eh. I picked this up because I was fascinated by the decision to put Dazai Osamu into an isekai anime. I'm a big fan of his works (listen, I literally named my cat after him. I have a Dazai Osamu jr in my home) but I'm a little picky about depictions of him (whatever Bungo Stray Dogs has going on is not my jam). The first few episodes made me nearly cry laughing. The character design, the way he carries himself, and the way he speaks really feels like the author is deeply, deeply invested in this man's life story. The concept itself is hilariousand the execution during the first few episodes really is top tier. 

After episode 3, things kinda of get repetitive...to the extent that I am not sure if this is a show worth finishing.

The worldbuilding is cute but generic isekai garbage and the side characters are similarly generic isekai fare. The saving grace of the show is, well, the dude who wrote The Setting Sun is comic relief and his suicidal and self-deprecating tendencies are dialed up to reflect that. I did enjoy the insistence that the only thing that could prevent Dazai Osamu from actually dying is isekai antics, but not really much else beyond that. 

As for the storyline...well. It's a story. There is a plot. There are definitely 12 episodes of content here. I had desperately hoped it would end completely in episode 12, but to my chagrin, more episodes are needed to wrap up all the little plot points introduced near the end. 

If you want a little laugh, go for this one. If you have ever wondered what Dazai Osamu might be like in an isekai, go for this one. If you want something gripping and interesting...maybe pass on this one. Ultimately: it's fine."
52367,538883.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"From the beginning of the episode to episode 5, this anime might be interesting enough to watch. The comedy is good, and it's not boring to watch, but not for the next episode! The initial concept was about an MC who wanted to commit suicide, but the concept was suddenly discarded, why did this happen? Even though the comedy when he wanted to commit suicide was quite good, the longer the suicidal intention just disappeared. Reason for wanting to commit double suicide with Sachan? I don't think so, because I don't see Sensei actually wanting to do that at all! The storyline increasingly deviates from the initialconcept, Sensei is dragged into various conflicts with side characters and characters close to him.
I honestly don't really like this, because it's not really important to know each character's past from them!
Still the same as I mentioned before, Sensei lost his intention to commit suicide! Suddenly he wanted to become a writer!
What? What made sensei want to become a writer? Where did the initial goal he mentioned earlier, like wanting to commit suicide or double suicide with Sachan? It was all just bullshit! 

In addition to the genre or theme, this anime should add Detective as one of its genres, why? Because Sensei here is more into solving other people's problems, Like a detective, he also tries to find out the origin of the problem, and strangely enough, only Sensei knows the secret compared to the others.
Yes, another mistake is that Sensei has turned into someone who solves other people's problems.

Too many flashbacks! Do you know Naruto anime? Yeah, it's like that! When a new character comes in, their past will also be told.
So, what is Sensei's actual goal?
People who want to commit suicide?
Double suicide with Sachan?
A writer?
Or become a detective solving other people's problems?

You judge for yourself!"
52367,538658.0,9.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"A non-thorough review on No Longer Allowed I gave this anime a chance because I didn't have much to watch this season (Fall 2024 is stacked though), but I would say I enjoyed it. The writing was not particularly elaborate or impressive, but Sensei, the MC, has a comically depressed and suicidal nature which I find to be a nice breath of fresh air. As an author (more like a journalist), he does occasionally find motivation to study people who seem interesting, or to call people out for bullsh*t. To be very blunt, there is not much to praise the anime for, and I'm sure manypeople might find Sensei more annoying than comedic. I did like the opening and ending songs, and I personally like Sensei's design a lot too. 

If you just want to take a break from other anime and you seem interested in the main character, it wouldn't hurt to watch this 12-episoder. The writing is a bit awkward sometimes, and the characters often feel one dimensional. A few of the episodes might stand out as decent, but for the most part the show is mediocre. 8.2/10, I would watch a second season but I won't be surprised if it doesn't happen"
52367,539443.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"This is basically the Isekai / Fantasy version of Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. A depressed writer almost achieves his dream of committing double suicide with his lover Sacchan, when they're both hit by a truck and sent to another world. Sensei is welcomed as a hero who would save the world from the dark lord - but he is extremely weak without any cheat powers, and furthermore, he has no intention of saving anyone. His only goal is to find Sacchan, who, presumably ended up somewhere else, and finish up their original suicide plan, though he wouldn't mind it even if he dies before finding her. Furthermore, itseems that the dark lord had already been slain by other otherworlders, those with real cheat powers, which then become as tyrant as the dark lord himself, if not more so.
Surprisingly, it seems that Sensei is the world's big hope against the rogue otherworlders. He's joined by the elf who welcomed him to the world, as well as a beastwoman whom he accidentally ended up saving from a monster while attempting to get killed by said monster.
Sensei can potentially save the world - but that might prove to be difficult, seeing that he has no motive to do so and just wants to die."
52367,538416.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Isekai Shikkaku has a very bold plot with an anti-hero to top it off. First of all, I would like to tell you that this was inspired in the story ""Ningen Shikkaku"" by Dazai Osamu - this author committed a double suicide after writting this story. If you don't know the reference, then the anime seems very weird in the beginning... But if you know, then it will seem extra awesome! You can watch Ningen Shikkaku animated on the anime ""Aoi Bungaku"". Now, our main character ""Sensei"" is a classic character from japanese literature, he's the post-war depressive bohemian author that is thrown into an isekaiand given the mission to save the world! BUT it seems he's lacking any skill besides his poison immunity and the fact that he himself is poisonous (but only if someone tries to take a piece of him). He has no intent of being a hero, saving the world, or even staying alive. And yet, we have character development! The plot twist is that he actually has a skill that fits him perfectly and gives objetive to him and to the plot of this anime, making it awesome. Each episode we meet a new character, a plot gets solved, and the pacing is really fine!

This anime had such a bold main character that it could easily end up as a bad anime, but the author was really good at guiding the story properly! It's not extraordinary, but in general it's a good anime.

Plot: 8/10 - It's original and well developed.
Characters: 10/10 - Lots of characters that have their stories told properly.
Animation: 6/10 - Not a strong point for this anime, but the art style makes up for it!

If you are bored MC's that are more or less identical or isekai story lines that does not bring anything new to the table - this might interested you.

52367,539724.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"The version of Dazai Osamu in this anime is really cute. Although he has the attribute of wanting to end his life, he’s quite awkward about it. When he’s truly needed, he acts like a real teacher, guiding everyone and providing help. This makes him one of the more interesting interpretations of Dazai among the many variations. The comedic elements of the story dilute his inherent sense of despair and gloom, enhancing its overall readability. Other characters feel a bit generic, but overall, it's a smooth story. I read the subsequent manga plot on mangajikan.com, and the main highlights of the anime compared to themanga are Dazai's otherworldly adventures, the restoration of the original delicate art style, and the voice acting by Hiroshi Kamiya. It’s rare to hear Kamiya use such a low, melancholic tone; compared to Mamoru Miyano’s portrayal of Dazai in ""Bungo Stray Dogs,"" it's a completely different enjoyment."
52367,540155.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"If you’re looking for an isekai anime with a fresh twist, “No Longer Allowed in Another World” may just surprise you. This show revolves around a real-life author who gets transported to another world and, quite uniquely, travels by coffin. Instead of following the typical isekai formula where the protagonist builds a new life in a fantastical world, the core idea here is about banishing other characters from Earth back to their original world. It’s a refreshing take in a genre that can often feel repetitive. One of the most notable aspects of this anime is its concept of sending characters back to Earth. Most isekaishows involve characters getting stuck or thriving in their new world, but this idea flips that convention, which I haven’t seen much in anime (though it does appear in some manga). This unique angle brings a new dynamic to the genre, adding complexity to the typical power fantasy trope.

While I haven’t come across another anime that handles this exact premise, it’s possible that some titles slipped under the radar. However, even if there are similar stories out there, “No Longer Allowed in Another World” still manages to feel fresh and brings some innovation to the overcrowded isekai genre.

If you’ve been looking for an isekai with a more original storyline that doesn’t feel too formulaic, this anime might be worth checking out. It offers a decent plot twist on the familiar isekai formula, though how well it holds up will depend on how the story develops. 8/10 would recommend and can’t wait for season 2."

If people come out of this learning a thing or two more about feelings and that there's no such thingtruly as ""good"" and ""bad"" then this anime has absolutely done its job.

52481,537619.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"""Making a Miracle"" aka, Souta Ueno's Gimai Seikatsu Studio Deen isn’t exactly known for producing standout anime, right? But every now and then, with enough effort, passion, and time, miracles happen. Gimai Seikatsu is one such miracle, exceeding all expectations. The author and director worked closely together, co-writing scripts, and the director reinterpreted scenes while adding details that enhanced the story. In fact, the adaptation impressed the original author so much that they said, “This is better than my book”—which is about the highest praise any anime creator could dream of. The pacing, storyboards, and camera angles are on par with what you'd expect from a top-tierstudio like Shaft. This show completely redefines the romance genre. It’s inspiring, grounded in realism, and breaks away from the usual rom-com tropes to delve deeper into the psychological states of the characters. I’d even classify it more as a psychological slice-of-life rather than a straight-up romance. There’s a sense of uncertainty running through the whole show, but it’s not your typical “will-they-won’t-they” tension.

At its heart, Gimai Seikatsu asks a simple but profound question: What happens when you bring two strangers together? Will they become friends? Lovers? Married, perhaps? Or something else entirely? This is a realistic romance with realistic characters, and that only enhances the pacing. Every emotional development feels earned—nothing is forced.

The execution is flawless. Aside from the sometimes bad facial animation. Yuuta’s fear of women and love, combined with Saki’s hesitation toward relationships, creates a compelling dynamic. While Yuuta tries to objectively confront his desires, he often finds himself overwhelmed by his emotions. But one of the show’s key messages is that you shouldn’t ignore your feelings—expressing them is the only way to move forward. We’re all human, after all, and having desires and emotions isn’t wrong. Yes, feelings can be selfish, but bottling them up only leads to more pain.

What will tomorrow bring for them? That’s the unending question. The burden of carrying unconventional love is heavy, but by the end, Asamura confesses, and Saki accepts his feelings. In love, one of the most important things is being able to rely on each other, helping one another along the way, and finding comfort in the relationship.

Yesterday, they were strangers. Slowly, they grew closer. But what about tomorrow?

This show exceeded my wildest expectations. It went above and beyond, delivering something truly remarkable. Thank you, Ueno-san and Mikawa-san, for your incredible work.

The best seasonal for me."
52481,537689.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Gimai Seikatsu, or Days with my Stepsister (DWS) exactly opposes the idea of “high concept media”- it is almost impossible to imagine a story simpler and more grounded. Though low concept media is viable, and can be excellent- look no further than Hyouka- it relies heavily on tightly written characters, and peripherals of its presentation. These include stunning animation or a superb soundtrack for visual media, or elegant prose for written media. Unfortunately, the anime adaptation of Gimai Seikatsu does not carry these aspects to a consistently high enough level to ascend its simple plot. DWS suffers from two primaryissues, the first of which is its ponderously slow pace.  Across all its forms, slow-paced media can be phenomenal, but there are diminishing marginal returns when decreasing the pace of plot.  DWS, to the extreme, refuses to rush its plot.  An example:
In one episode of the anime, two characters see a movie together.  Later on, a line from this movie is referenced for dramatic effect, while one of the characters recreates the scene.  So far, so good.  The issue is that four and a half minutes- nearly a quarter of the time an episode runs- is spent showing the movie.  The scene in which DWS characters re-enact a small part of it?  Only three minutes.  
Less than five minutes may seem like a small issue, but in a twelve-episode anime, every second comes at a premium.  Frequently, simple, everyday chores are shown in such a way that buttering a piece of bread may take 10-15 seconds, and background shots with no dialogue also seem to occupy much of the run time.  Add the line delivery, which is so slow as to be occasionally comical, and the pace of DWS seems artificially glacial.  Which brings us to the second problem with this show.  
Animation quality is not all encompassing, and a poorly animated show can still be good- but DWS is absolutely hamstrung by how it looks.  Frankly, it is distracting how often still background shots are cut to in an effort to avoid animating movement.  The camera is frequently placed below characters’ heads, so their mouth can be ignored.  My theory is that the absurdly slow pace serves to diminish the number of slides that need to be drawn.  In a show about simple, everyday interactions, the visual quality should be superb, reminiscent of “still life” paintings, but is instead reminiscent of 1969 Scooby-Doo.  This is an unfair standard, but DWS is an entirely different show if it looks like Violet Evergarden.  
Despite my complaints, DWS seems to possess some mystical quality which interferes with the passage of time and makes it surprisingly watchable.  Nearly every episode, I would be shocked hearing the ED fade into the background, convinced I had only been 8 or 10 minutes into it.  Probably due to its lethargic pace, my mind kept expecting more had to happen in an episode, so therefore I couldn’t be through with it already. 
Also a note in the positive column is how incredibly relaxing DWS is to watch.  Completely in contrast to most anime, the characters not only communicate at the level real people do, but way overshare, which leads to quick resolution of conflicts that aren’t elevated from standard high school trope schlock.  It’s not genius, risky, or thought provoking, but it works, so if you want to turn your brain off and enjoy a low-drama romance (not enough comedy to be a romcom) then this may be exactly what you’re looking for. 
DWS has potential but is very likely hamstrung by budget.  In the hands of a different studio, this could be a real gem.  It’s just good enough for me to recommend if nothing else is speaking to you."
52481,537611.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Despite the title, Gimai Seikatsu or “Days with my Stepsister” is one of the best written romances of all time in my opinion. It is the first show of its kind to actually illustrate the challenges of two teenagers suddenly becoming siblings and having to navigate the newfound family dynamic. It’s a mature story that feels reminiscent of A24 films in terms of direction, narrative, scene composition and overall vibe. Characters talk with understated realistic diction and tone, and episodes while slow, are fulfilling. This is truly a must watch for any cinema enthusiast, romance fan or those just wanting an anime that feels plausiblefor once instead of the dozens of exaggerated goonbait shows we get every year. 

I know, I know, we have had quite a few “step-sister” anime in recent years, most revolving around comedic gags, “incest” bait and just your usual silly anime reused tropes. And don’t get me wrong, I don’t hate that, but after 20+ of them they all start feeling a bit samey. What’s cool about Gimai Seikatsu is that the people act like real humans. They don’t fall in love just because someone said something nice to them, they aren’t sneaking and stealing underwear, getting flustered all the time, etc. Instead, you have two teens are thrust into this unfamiliar situation and try their best to work through things together. Slowly getting to know one another and growing as people in the process. On paper, Saki and Yuta couldn’t be more different as people, but after living together they realise they have a lot of the same insecurities and problems and this acts as a bonding device for the two of them. This was great for me because the way Saki’s trendy gyaru-esque persona is slowly chipped away at throughout the series is reminiscent of the way you assume things about people irl and then come to see they’re not like that at all, and you see you actually have more in common than you thought. Yuta’s distrust for women because of his mother’s actions and Saki’s trepidation towards men because of the rumours she and her mother have been subjected to initially serve as barriers, but are broken down in a very sweet way.

The pacing of the show is very slow, it’s not uncommon for entire episodes to be dedicated to 1 or 2 conversations, but the way those conversations are framed and directed makes them feel engaging and they go by so quickly. One example of this is the journal sequences where we get an insight into Saki’s true thoughts and feelings. Those scenes felt so intimate and raw that I got completely lost in them. There’s a level of emotional vulnerability that the author is able to convey in this story that few others can. I often say the best anime are the ones where you forget they’re anime because of how organic and real they feel and this anime has that. The slow burn build up to Saki and Yuta realising their feelings for one another is beautiful. I think it’s right in that sweet spot of not being too slow where you get frustrated, but not being too soon where you don’t care about the romance because of it being shallow or based on a flimsy foundation. I saw a lot of “symptoms” of love in this show that aren’t uncommon in the real world. Often times you start feeling jealous or a desire to be around someone all the time before the realisation comes that you’re in love. Sometimes we go through denial or run from our feelings if we feel it’s an inappropriate relationship as well and this show just captures all that.

Now I’ve talked about the step sibling aspect, but another cool part of the story is the step parents themselves. Yuta’s dad is kinda just there, cool guy but doesn’t get a big arc. BUT. Saki’s mom and her desire to be accepted Yuta is really well done. Usually these shows just focus on the kids falling in love, but there’s a whole new parent stepping into the mix and for most people that’s going to take some time getting used to. As a step parent, you obviously want to be accepted by your new son or daughter and you know you’ll never be their biological parent, but there’s that awkward period where you’re unsure where you stand. I like the way this is done between the two of them and by the end seeing Yuta accept her as his step mother and go public with her and Saki as siblings at school is really cool. Minor thing, but just made it feel more authentic to me.

Ok I’ve talked enough about the story. It’s great. But the other really awesome thing about this series is the direction. It looks incredible and the cinematography is among the best I’ve ever seen. For this to be a studio DEEN work, I was blown away. Again just goes to show you that staff matter more than studio. The scene composition is absolutely amazing, use of lighting and shadows to illustrate moods, use of spacing and other really cool camera techniques just make this feel more like an auteur adventure rather than a seasonal anime. If you’re at all into A24 films or Robert Eggers, you’ll see a lot of that energy in this anime!

Gimai Seikatsu is truly an amazing show and it’s a shame it got overshadowed by stuff like Roshidere this season. It’s one of the sweetest and most authentic romances in this medium and a joy to watch. I can’t wait to read the books.

Gimai Seikatsu gets a very easy 10 out of 10."

Where normal humans will laugh and cry, these two characters open their eyes slightly wider and get misty-eyed. For an anime that's been rated 7+ here I find myself, for the first time ever, in pretty big disagreement with the overall consensus. I felt as if i was watching a computer receive new computational input to process throughout an episode. Hell, I have a step sibling who has gone through the experience of a nasty divorce and still has a better grasp on human emotions than these tamagotchi replicants. I gave this alow score because even if I think an anime is ""meh"", I can usually still ""watch"" it while playing a videogame or doing some other task. This anime has caused me to stop whatever I was doing and ask, ""What the fuck?"" so many times that I just gave up. I finished this show out of sheer perseverance."
52481,537613.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Days with My Stepsister - Don't, and NEVER, judge a book by its cover. If there's one thing that I absolutely loathe about the AniManga industry of the current age, most particularly of new incoming anime fans since the turn of the COVID pandemic, leasing anime to pretty much just about anyone, it's that humanity's brain cells have slowly lost all reasoning to what makes the series stand out, more than just looking at the cover of a book (say manga or novel) and judging by the assumption that it'll end like so and so. Such is the case with novelist Ghost Mikawa's Gimai Seikatsu a.k.aDays With My Stepsister, which, despite showing off a boy and a girl living together as stepsiblings that could potentially cross into ""Sweet Home Alabama"" land, is the BIGGEST misconception you could ever have to assume what this series is all about. And it winning the 3rd place in Takarajimasha's annual Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! guidebook in the new work category in 2022, this award in and of itself should say a lot about how the domestic audience really loves the series, and how you, the audience, should feel the same.

The story / plot about complete strangers coming to form a family with different given and family names, these cases may or may not be uncommon to whatever you perceive relationships and marriage to be, but circumstances like divorce are realistic enough that the idea of re-marriage to a different person feels surreal, much less having to call someone who isn’t blood-related their own stepsibling. This is exactly the case for the main stepsibling “couple” of Yuta Asamura and Saki Ayase, of whom their respective parents, the former’s father Taichi and the latter’s mother Akiko, once had a divorce for various reasons, and remarried towards one another, seeking a new life after a past disappointment. Their respective children, on the other hand, must get to know each other, but also keep a distance against each other after seeing the toxic relationship that their now single parent had to deal with, and mutually agreeing not to sow anymore discord in the foundation of the new family. It’s quite the story, if you ask me, taken from real-life examples.

And this is quite the ride for novelist Ghost Mikawa, having seen the project through its paces from its humble beginnings not from the LN, but from it being a mixed-media project starting with the YouTube channel of the same name right around the turn of COVID in April 2020. However, it’s important to note that what came out of the LN is quite different (or inspired) from the content on YouTube, and the latter’s start was derived when the author himself learned of the existence of a reader who had a request to ""deeply dig into the daily life of the characters"", and was interested in seeing what would happen if he tried to write an unusual work, which was when he decided to write a story depicting the relationship between stepsiblings. Ghost Mikawa may be the original author, but the script of the story is handled by multiple writers, and the writing style of each writer is shown in each script of the videos, so it is often taken as it is.

Regarding the story that the novelist decided to pen on the LN since then (taking excerpts from his interview with Anime Corner), Gimai Seikatsu is basically the result of him formulating a work of art and theme, based on observations, guesswork, and sometimes by confronting himself to find out what kind of problems people in society are facing, what kind of issues they are feeling, and what kind of values they are living under. This is ESPECIALLY important looking within the context of Japan, where its society is suffering from late marriages and domestic problems, and that many individuals are suffocating from problems in love and social interaction due to conflicts, whether on-site or online with the rise of social media and infamy for doxxing. The idea was to depict two ideal people who can overcome such relationship problems firmly and powerfully.

What sets both Yuta and Saki apart are the genetic traits taken straight form their parents: the latter is much more subservient on her own life’s duties, considering that her mother Akiko works in a red-light district effortlessly and tirelessly to raise her, Saki has always been left alone (isolated would be a better word for this) most of the time, and that slowly grew to her being an independent state who doesn’t know when to speak up if she needs to be tended to for help. That’s where Yuta steps in as her opposing equivalent, someone who cares not just for his father, but also the friends around him so much that he is an invaluable partner and confidante in the long run, being someone who serves the need whenever he needs or senses to. Something which Ghost Mikawa himself notes on the “relationship” of both characters, most notably on the “rom-com” genre that the series is painted, is that the romanticization of Yuta and Saki is pretty much intentionally done, not just because he’s not the kind of person who feels that the lovey-dovey stuff would be too “fake” for a story that’s all about people dealing with real-life relationship circumstances, but because he wants to portray the merging of the broken families in a realistic manner and get the audience to see and watch its genuineness as if they're real people, as fictionalized as they are to begin with. From the life-sized daily life situations to fanservice (i.e. not in the way that Masachika Kuze and Yuki Suou’s sibling relationship in RoshiDere is handled) that are just fun and cute, there is a limit on the extent of realism vs. fakery enough to keep the series as entertaining and introspective as it is the way it’s being done. To that, I can tell you that most authors just ham-fist what they think they’re good at, but it takes the psychology to tell apart amateur authors from ones like Ghost Mikawa to write their series as plentiful and immersive as can be to deliver an experience that touches the heart of the human soul.

What the series ultimately sums it all down to is this: “Is it whether the characters have souls or not? No matter how good a plot you have, if the characters are not lovable as human beings, it will not feel like a good story. If you are so preoccupied with technique that you neglect the most important characters, readers will not be pleased with your work.” And I wholeheartedly agree with Ghost Mikawa that his thoughts are right on the log, as the series is basically a daily diary between both Yuta Asamura and Saki Ayase, two complete strangers studying in the same school, with one being an average Joe and the other being like a school Madonna figure of admiration. The young high school adults having to skirt around the realization that the fact of them being stepsiblings will warrant a whole barrage of questions from friends both in school and outside and keeping a mutual agreement on their relationship as nothing more than just the usual family-business-donned brother and sister figure. If both young adults want to keep their relationship as the uncommon status quo, no one is forcing them to become a couple, and this is for the best interests of time, place, and occasion, even if they end up being one in the long run with the approval of both the new-found family and friends around them. And I’ll tell you that I love stories like this that are fictionally unorthodox, but still gives a full hint of realism enough to believe that no stone goes unturned, and every decision has weight that could pay the price in significant ways, if not handled maturely.

Studio Deen has long since been the epitome of bad production cycles, but in the hands of capable people, even 3rd-rate studios can punch out some magnificent animation, as is the case for Gimai Seikatsu. Even though its staff team doesn’t consist of notable people, it’s all under the hands of debut director Souta Ueno to deliver Ghost Mikawa’s expectations to the small screen, and dare I say that he exceeded them. The use of cinematography to tell through the days of the daily diary log, and the always vibrant lights and dark hues that don’t disguise the real-life imitation of realism, this anime is undoubtedly one of the best and most consistently produced shows of the season, and I’m not kidding at all if the beautiful and gorgeous sakuga like this hasn’t gone appreciated by the masses. Props to Souta Ueno and his staff team for their commitment to this passion project of a show.

It’s been a while since we’ve last heard fhána (since Kobayashi-san no Maid Dragon), and while their OP song is definitely a lot on the brighter side, it’s also enticing to a degree that’s just unmistakably fhána. Kitri’s ED is also slow, but smooth-sailing and warmly inviting.

Going back to my main point about Gimai Seikatsu a.k.a Days with My Stepsister, it is a show that you absolutely CANNOT objectify and classify it with other siscon-based works out there (case in point, Ghost Mikawa’s favourite series of all time: OreImo). That said, I will argue that this show does serve a niche target audience that will test the patience and divide the crop into a love-hate affair, aside from the constant complaint of “boringness” of static moments where introspection takes place. It’s a thinking man’s game, yet one that’s intentionally and purposefully bulked with sympathy and empathy enough to put yourself in one’s shoes to see it from their POV, and as I’ve already eluded that this show does so much good to not only respect the adaptation of the LN, but also to restore humanity with its elevation.

Not everything needs to be the abridged version of a fanfic, even at the cusp of pressure, and I just love the anime so much for respecting that basic aim. I respect Ghost Mikawa for not pandering to the masses and knowing his trajectories enough to give us a solid series that’s worth all the immersive enjoyment, and at the end of the day, it's one brillant message: fiction, but with a touch of realism."
52481,537772.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"The only thing I can comment about is how realistic the setting is. Nothing feels fantasy like in it. I almost got anxiety watching them interact, as if I have to bear consequences of their actions, that realistic it felt. It's not a romance in the generic sense, it's a psychological session, asking you questions even when you don't relate to any of the scenarios. The ever building tension was high enough to keep giving me shivers, yet the beauty of the animations kept me hooked. The way the pacing and narrative went by, just makes me feel it's the beginning of something so miniscule,yet that something is paramount for all the characters involved. The subtle tension of keeping others happy by sacrificing your own hits so close to home. When you think after years finally you can open up, everything comes back crumbling down on you, the world feels suffocating and irritating. And that was really beautifully shown here. It's not a fantasy, it won't have you giggling and laughing, but in tears, not even giving you a chance to recover, because it knows, it's not a story about Asamura and Ayase, it's about every kid who bottled up their emotions, romantic or not, for the sake of someone else."
52481,537642.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"At first glance, Gimai Seikatsu might seem like another addition to the well-worn trope of step-sibling romance, a genre that often brings a fair share of skepticism due to its tendency to veer into trashy territory. However, this series manages to subvert expectations, delivering a surprisingly nuanced and thoughtful exploration of a difficult family dynamic. The plot centers on Yuuta Asamura, a high schooler whose father remarries, leaving him with a new stepsister, Saki Ayase, who also happens to be one of the most popular girls at school. The two agree to maintain a certain distance, neither too close nor antagonistic, trying to keep things comfortablein light of their newfound living situation. This setup, while familiar, serves as the backdrop for what becomes an unexpectedly introspective look at the complexities of their evolving relationship.

The show’s greatest strength lies in its execution. On a technical level, it boasts strong production values, with clean art, fluid animation, and an effective sound design. But what truly sets it apart is its direction. The way the series uses framing, lighting, and subtle cues to convey the emotional states of its characters elevates it beyond the surface-level drama. There are many moments where the show lets the characters' internal struggles breathe through silence, body language, and careful composition, creating a sense of authenticity and emotional tension.

As for the narrative itself, the series takes its time establishing the awkwardness of the situation. Both Yuuta and Saki are teenagers suddenly thrust into a new family structure, forced to navigate not only their own personal feelings but also the broader implications of their parents' remarriage. Their interactions are tentative, hesitant, and layered with a sense of unease as they gradually get used to their new reality. The pacing of their relationship is slow but deliberate, which makes their eventual bond feel earned and genuine. Watching them go from strangers to hesitant allies and then to something more is a journey that feels surprisingly believable.

What makes this series particularly interesting is how it tackles the emotional complexity of their growing feelings. Both characters are fully aware of the societal taboos surrounding step-sibling romance, and they struggle with it. Their emotions are messy, contradictory, and often repressed. They care deeply for their parents and don’t want to risk disrupting their new family dynamic, leading them to bottle up their feelings or question their validity. This internal conflict adds depth to the characters and makes their connection feel more human and relatable.

Conversely, while the show largely succeeds in handling its central relationship, there are a few missteps. Most notably, the supporting cast often serves as a not-so-subtle nudge toward the inevitable romantic conclusion. In several scenes, characters either directly or indirectly push Yuuta and Saki toward one another, sometimes in an overly obvious or forced manner. This is most egregious during a university open day, where a random teacher psychoanalyzes Saki and spells out her emotional state in a heavy-handed way. It's a clumsy narrative device that detracts from the otherwise subtle progression of the characters’ relationship.

This railroading feels out of place in a show that, for the most part, handles its subject matter with care. While it’s true that in romance media we often expect certain outcomes, the journey from point A to point B is almost a given, the way the story navigates that path is crucial. The moments where the writing feels contrived stand in contrast to the otherwise organic development of Yuuta and Saki’s bond, making these scenes feel jarring.

Despite these occasional stumbles, the anime manages to deliver a fresh take on a premise that often falls into predictability or outright mediocrity. The relationship between Yuuta and Saki is handled with a degree of care and realism that makes the viewer invest in their journey, even if the destination is expected. The awkwardness, tension, and emotional complexity are all palpable, and while the series does fall into some narrative traps, it more than makes up for it with its strong direction and character work.

The final resolution is fitting, there’s no grand, triumphant moment of romance, but rather a quiet, introspective acknowledgment that the road ahead will be difficult. It’s a conclusion that feels true to the tone of the series, emphasizing the uncertain, fragile nature of their relationship. In this way, it offers a refreshing and grounded take on the step-sibling romance genre, making it a surprisingly worthwhile watch for those willing to give it a chance."
52481,538752.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"This anime might be the standout for the summer 2024 season. Of course, given that its competition is the militant absurdity of ""nokotan"", the mid rom-com ""Alya"", the incomprehensible ode to stupidity ""vtuber legend"", that is a really low bar. This anime shone mostly because its competition sucked so hard. Anyway, I actually really liked this anime. This anime is about two teenagers, a boy and a girl, both who have been damaged by life and find trusting very difficult, who end up living in the same house because their parents married. In the beginning, they accept their situation, but really don't wanta whole lot to do with each other, and they agree to just get along but nothing more.

As the anime progresses, however, they begin to grow closer, and start trusting each other.

As with most romances (or quasi-romances) of this genre, though, the result isn't really the point, it's the journey.  There are no (or very few) comedic misunderstandings, no domestic violence played for laughs, very little fanservice, nothing like that.  Just two people who are bumbling through life just like all of us, and somehow learn to find comfort in each other as kindred souls.  It's a sensitively treated story where they are no bad or good guys, just humans, and people learning how to trust.

A very sweet story.  The only real criticism I have is that the story is a bit unfinished, but I think they were leaving it open for a second season, so I'll take it.

Recommend from me.  And given the relative paucity of good anime in this season, that's a breath of fresh air."
52481,537610.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Gimai Seikatsu (Days with My Stepsister) may be what can be described as a misunderstood anime. The title itself and romance genre brings together questions on whether this may include psuedo incest content. And if so, that would bring nothing less than controversy. Luckily, you can ease your fear because Days with My Stepsister isn't a show about dating. At the heart of the show involves the step-brother and step-sister. Both attend high school students in their second year and it's here that the story evolves. Yuuta Asamura stars as the main protagonist as an ordinary guy with no distinctive traits. He tends to keep tohimself and remains distant with others. On the other hand, we meet Saki Ayase, a cold beauty who tends to avoid others and in some ways, similar to Yuuta. Watching the first few episodes gives the impression that the pair does not know each other very well. It's only as they spend more time together that they begin to open up because from the first few episodes, they look more like strangers than step siblings.

Told in a narrative format with heavy dialogues and inner thoughts, this show protrays a very melancholic mood. There's a mixture of emotional drama that often sees how characters think from their point of view. This is prominently displayed through the eyes of Saki as she wonders about her daily life and reflecting with others she thinks of. The most important person in her life is Yuuta although she does not recognize this herself at first. That's because Yuuta takes a practical approach at living life. He takes on life in a realistic way such as working at a local bookstore, going to school, and avoiding trouble whenever possible. Realistically, it's the most fundamental way of how a person can live. Yuuta doesn't possess any extraordinary gifts so naturally, he doesn't go out his way to prove himself to anyone. 

Similarly, Saki tends to hide her own emotions, and accomplishes this rather well. In public, it's almost if she's wearing a mask to cover her personality. However, she has nothing sinister to hide because deep down, she is a kind and gentle person. She just isn't the type that tries to be the girl next door. Saki's character slowly progresses and she shows more emotions, particuarly towards Yuuta. However, I will say to keep expectations in check. Through her diary entries, body language, and character expressions, Saki really isn't someone who befriend others easy. The anime contains a mellow mood that explores the depths of human feelings. Yuuta and Saki displays similar emotions that sometimes, you have to wonder if they're the same person.

The show contains a small character cast which effectively works although Saki and Yuuta overshadows the majority of them. Saki's classmate Maaya adds some energy to the otherwise melacholic show while university student Shiori shows maturity and being the responsiblity of young adult. Reflecting on Saki and Yuuta's character stories, it really will take patience for viewers to warm up to them. The main point of this show is giving us viewers the chance to see what their lives is like while developing an important relationship.

Told through heavy narratives, key moments are highlighted through the usage of letterbox format. It's a clever usage of chereography as it makes the scenes feel important and memorable. Throughout this show, there will be many flashbacks that takes control of the story narrative. Studio Deen effectively delivered those chereography with its clean  animation. Furthermore, character designs are decorated with a soft, delicate feature, especially for Saki Ayase. The show omits any type of cartoony reactions and instead uses more realistic human expressions. If you ask me, this show set out to do what it wanted on day one.

Even if it's misunderstood at first glance, there's plenty of time to grow and accept the anime for what it tries to tell us. Main protagonists Yuuta and Saki tells their story and molds it together as their relationship develops. Rom-coms like this can also be despairing to watch with the oversatured amount of melacholic moments. But for Days with My Stepsister, it's a journey that is worth following."
52481,537993.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Gimai Seikatsu - A romance anime which is different from another romance anime But why is it so? That's what I am gonna tell you. This series is about the relationship between a boy and a girl who become step-siblings because their parents decide to marry each other. Pretty normal, isn't? The thing is that the word ' stepsister ' is enough for people to get a wrong idea, but this anime tries it best to divert the minds of people from that idea and think about the whole relationship between step-siblings once more with deep thoughts. The anime is pretty slow-paced but if you think aboutit, it seems logical as the kind of relationship they wanna show is something that may become weird and gross in a split second if not handled properly.  As for the animation, it isn't as good as I expected it to be or maybe you can say that it is pretty average but the creative handling of it is something that is appreciable. The way the past is shown like a footage tape is really good to watch. 
Now the most important question which I mentioned in the starting : How is it different from other romance anime ? 
Gimai Seikatsu starts with a very serious tone and a serious quote and this was enough to make it stand out from others. The sries is slow paced to make it feel as natural as possible and raises some thought provoking questions as to what is right and what is wrong. It doesn't rely on the cute expressions and blushing moments like other anime, rather it explores the relationship of the recently established step-siblings.
This is enough for it to be different from others.
I think this is more than enough to create an image of the anime, see the rest for yourselves.
Thank you for reading!"
52481,538362.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"""Deceive your heart all you want, but if you don't resolve this, it will scorn you. And before you know it, you'll be scarred forever."" Story & Characters: Days with My Stepsister is truly a wonderful anime series to experience, and I'm not sure if I could treasure this more in a controversial topic. It speaks to what happens when stepbrother and stepsister start to have romantic feelings for each other and the obvious complications that come with such a taboo. I, of course, am I talking about Saki Ayase and Yuuta Asamura. The former's mother and latter's father get married atthe start of this series, and it's here that our characters meet and make every attempt they can to make sure their new family stays as one happy family.

There's so much to unpack as to why I like this series, but I think I'll start with the thing that sticks out the most.  That is the tone that series sets at every turn.  It takes a extremely mature take on this topic, mirroring the dialogue that an older series known as Love Wind, takes.  At first, it's completely about trying to make sure their family meshes.  Saki and Yuuta have very strong feelings about how their parents should have the best life, due to the natures of how their previous family broke down.  While this isn't dug into too much, we know enough to give us an idea why our characters treasure family so much.  As our characters go through their daily lives, they slowly start to realize something is amiss - that they believe they are having romantic feelings towards one another, a taboo in most everyone's minds.

Saki and Yuuta put on very strong fronts, not because they're always headstrong, but because they feel they need to.  They have their birth parents - who work tirelessly long hours - who they treasure now that their other birth parents are not in the mix, they have their sibling, who they need to get along with because they're now step siblings, and now they have their step parent, who makes their birth parent so happy.  It all makes sense, and they will look for no angle that will sour on their experience as a family.  I love this about them because they don't show malice towards their new living arrangement.  But what happens when it starts to push too far into loving their stepsibling?

Contrary to the title, Saki feels more like our main character than Yuuta, especially in the second half.  As she spends more time with Yuuta, she tries to pull herself into his space, but does so gently, and slowly.  It's here that she tries to learn through ""experience"", to see if her heart is telling her the same things that she thinks, and it's all wonderfully well written.  She doesn't have a ton of friends to confide in, and what really only pushes her is someone she meets near the end.  I didn't love how this particular scene played out because it kind of bounced out of nowhere, but the conversation at least felt correct for the feel the series is going for.  Maaya, a female classmate of Yuuta's, hangs around both of them and somewhat adds a nice element where we have someone that observes both of them, but she's not serious enough to really push the envelope.  This is something I appreciated because the overall feeling of the series seeks to stay mostly light.  Yuuta fights his feelings his own way too, but is far more outgoing that we start to see something leak out when he talks to colleagues.  Shiori is a coworker of Yuuta's and I'm uncertain how to feel about her.  She starts to feel like she has the Maaya role near the second half of the series, and feels somewhat redundant because of it.  Still, I appreciated that she adds more eyes onto both our main characters because the series is light on conversation as it is.   Near the end, Yuuta's classmate at cram school, Kaho, enters the picture and she's excellent for the series.  Her backstory is extremely harsh.  This really threw me off but she's such a welcome addition.  She pushes the story forward and somehow, Yuuta feels very comfortable talking to her calmly.

Where audiences might take issue with this series, outside of the controversial topic, is that issues aren't tackled head on.  It's not handled directly until the final few scenes.  Our characters withhold their feelings for one another so much, and Saki goes so far to say that she's keeping it ""bottled up"" and knows that she can't continue to do so without going crazy.  The series, overall, retains this 
relaxed feeling most of the time, and even when intense dialogue enters the fray, the series depends on us reacting to what's going on screen, when it seems possible that we might not.  Some people may go ""well, is that it?"".  I get it, but I was so into this series that this never occurred to me.  (Story: 10/10, Characters: 8/10)

Art: The animation was strong is very specific areas and weaker in others.  Studio Deen has done some excellent work with series such as Seven Deadly Sins and Sakura Trick.  Backgrounds went for a watercoloured shading, though had this weird line pattern through some scenes.  Not sure if this was intentional, but you can barely notice it unless you're looking really hard - it's not that obvious on mobile either.  Character designs were a mix of strong and different.  What I mean by the latter is that they had a habit of showing characters without their eyes at far-off camera shots.  While not terrible, I'm not sure what the goal was there.  However, lighting made this series really shine (pun not intended) during some of the nicer shots.  I was a huge fan of this.  Random thing, I was a huge fan of the way they coloured our characters' eyes though.  (8/10)

Sound: The atmosphere they go for is to constantly try and remain laid back, and the OST sure did that.  The OST is almost entirely light piano tunes and this matches up very well with the series.  The OP and ED also do the same job.  VA work is strong throughout - I would have liked to see how this series would have panned out with the right English dub actor because there was so much raw emotion that Yuki Nakashima (Saki) put through here that I don't feel like I truly appreciate when it's in a language I don't naturally understand.  (8/10)

Overall: Days with My Stepsister was fantastic, and should be a watch for any fan of the romance genre.  It doesn't try and be stark like Domestic Girlfriend, but rather, take a more serious approach that Love Wind does.  Yes, if you don't care for this subdivision of the romance genre, then this won't be something you'll enjoy.  But the story was so well written that I don't think I ever thought twice about not finishing this series.  If more were to come out, I'd gladly pick it up.  (9/10)"
52481,539300.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"I have my issues with the story but I have to admit that this is an excellent production. It's so artistic in its style that in the first few episodes it seems like it might've been an arthouse psychological film. Maybe that will alienate some people that will find it too slow, but I'm into that. The directing, soundtrack, shot composition are excellent, and even though the style of animation it uses most of the time isn't cutting edge for different purposes it stylizes animation depending on the occasion was a really clever choice. There's a very skillful use of non linear storytelling for spots. We'll seesomething about to happen, next scene is the next day, and in the next episode we're shown what happened in very efficient flashbacks. Or we'll see details of how another character experienced the same moment in a different way. And they're so well done, it doesn't feel like a flashback in the tedious way most shows in a ""We interrupt this for a drawn out flashback"".
And beyond just flashbacks a lot of details are shown as memories to let the audience know why and how a character is thinking as they navigate their feelings.

Even the way the framing of scenes is done to convey details of what's going on in the story is uncharacteristically cinematic for anime, and even more for this genre. For example, when there's scenes of people drifting apart, the ""shot"" will frame characters looking physically distant even though they're sitting at the same table. And even the way the directing allows for silence to play a role in the dialogue during arguments is really impressive. 

The only problem I have is that the story let me down. The first two episodes had me intrigued. For a change it seemed like it WOULDN'T follow the formula of the step-sibling trope and the guy with a friendly co-worker, but it very disappointingly did. It felt we were in for a more unique take on things, but it weirdly speedran its way into all the clichés out there. To the point the last two episodes and first two feel like completely different universes and characters. Also, around episode 6, the story started to revolve exclusively around the sister and how our MC suddenly decides to make it his mission to help her and a lot of character nuance that had been established about him fades into the background. 
And this probably won't be an issue for 'newer' watcher, but for someone like me who remembers watching Clannad After Story as it came out weekly, archetypes don't work on me that much anymore.
And, despite it being very well done from a technical aspect, as I pointed out, ultimately the story felt like the weakest link.

The characters did stand out for actually having a personality at first, but then it became a frustrating mess. And it doesn't help that the main girl reminds me a lot of my second girlfriend, and that brought up some unpleasant flashbacks of my own as the similarities in personality were uncanny at times. The manipulative arguing, the weaponized self-pity and trying to get as close as possible only to randomly start pushing people away... It might sound silly but that resonated with me in an unpleasant way.

I can't say it's a bad show, because it isn't and I did enjoy it for the incredibly skilled production it is, but I can't say it's great either."
52481,538436.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"The first word that comes to me about this series is maturity. When I saw the title of this anime I have presumed that it will be another generic, simple, typical ecchi story but it turns out to be completely different. I could have never guessed that this show will be so much mature, so serious and so real. Every scene is precisely planned, every camera angle is astonishing. That is the top tier direction, shoutout to the director for that. Even the scene where characters are just simply eating reveals to us so much. We can almost feel ourselves what are the thoughts, feelings andeven the mental state of the characters from eating. 

 When it comes to the story and drama, they are also wonderful. This show breaks free from any tropes that romance anime have and it creates its owned identity. It really stands out from the crowd. This series really give attention for the psychology of the characters. The doubts, denial, anxiety, relations with the others and many, many other things make this show so real. It encourages us for the reflections about the live, society, standards that are imposed on us and the meaning of another person in our life. Slow pacing only adds more meaning for the series. On top of all of that, the message of this production is really meaningful – we are all humans and we can’t keep our feelings bottled up, we must be sincere about what we feel.

I highly recommend this for anyone who you are looking for series with great psychology, mature and mindful scenes, important message, great drama and realistic approach this anime is exactly for you."
52481,537616.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"When your parent suddenly finds a new partner and with it comes a new stepsibling, can it become quite problematic when they are both teenagers in the same high school. Days with my stepsister follows Yuuta and Saki, whose parents recently introduced them to each other and decided the two families would move in together as one family. But having two teenagers of the opposite sex and the same age live together, can result in some different feelings evolving, which easily can prove problematic. The plot is taking the whole romance genre very seriously, it is not a romcom as could be expected, it is a pureromance. So the plot is very much built up around how a relationship is built up between Yuuta and Saki, now that they have to live together. They also show how it is known that this type of romance can be a taboo and how the two characters feel about the whole situation. The plot generally focuses on day to day things, but really digs into how the characters feel and think, which makes the story less grand and instead way more detailed.

What really carries the show is the characters, specifically the main characters, since we see both how they became who they are and what they experience now. Throughout the whole show do we get a clear look into the characters feelings and reasons for their progression forward. This really helps get one invested into the show, because you see both the good and bad in them and see them as the imperfect teenagers they are. When it comes to the side characters, are they mostly there to help support the show, they ask the question that triggers certain thoughts, is the reason certain situations happen and so on. Which with how the main characters are shown, gives a very harmonious build up throughout.

When it comes to the animation in the show, is the style a very artistic one, since they play a lot with both light, camera angles and filters. This is done in a way to highlight the mood and atmosphere in a scene, and also sometimes show what kind of scene it is. The camera angles also really help making it seem like you really are a fly on the wall in their life, which gives a very down to earth feeling. The animation in itself is done with great attention to detail, where even simple movements can be animated with movement through the whole body, which makes the show really feel alive.

Overall, is this a great show that doesn’t make fun of the whole premise of love between step siblings, but actually gives it a serious shot and shows the very nuanced aspects of it. So if the premise is interesting to you, would i definitely recommend watching Days with My Stepsister."
52481,540276.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"'Days with My Stepsister' seems to be one of those fake incest shows that's leaning more towards being lewd and tropey. It's understandable why people would stay clear of this anime given the title, but they are missing out. It's brilliant in its storytelling and would leave you with good feelings that you are watching something so great. § Overview Our main character Asamura Yuuta was one day greeted by his father that he would remarry and that Yuuta would have a new stepsister, Ayase Saki. At first, Yuuta and Saki are civil to each other. But through mere exposure, they develop feelings for each other. § FromLight Novels to Anime

Before the broadcast, I read light novel volume 1, and it's a brilliant piece of writing. It is chill and has the introspective vibe that I love. 

Can this same vibe be translated into anime? The director did his best to achieve similar effects.

This is the directorial debut of Director Ueno Souta (上野壮大).  


His challenge is the following:

1. He has to cover 4 light novel volumes within 12 episodes. 


2. He has to reproduce the vibe of the light novels even though several materials from them have to be omitted, or in some cases added to them.


3. He has to work within the constraint of a limited animation budget. 


Director Ueno has given the anime its own unique identity with his avant-garde direction of the anime. Even if, hypothetically speaking, he was to not give this anime the proper care that it deserves, I am confident that I would have liked it regardless and rate it so high just with the strength and virtue of mikawaghost先生's writing. Fortunately, Director Ueno has given the anime a decent animation with superb direction.

§ The Significance of the Title 義妹生活 (gimai seikatsu)

It comes from two words:

1. 義妹 (gimai), which means either stepsister or younger sister-in-law

2. 義妹 (seikatsu), which means day-to-day living or livelihood

mikawaghost先生 says that it has a double meaning. From the perspective of Yuuta, it means roughly the same thing as the English title ""Days with My Stepsister,"" but from the perspective of Saki, it means 'living as a stepsister,' which was the sense when she dropped the title in Episode 9.

Thus, if you think about it, it's a boring title and not something trashy that so many people have this instinctive reaction to. It's a slow-burn romance and moves at a natural pace.

The chapters in the light novels correspond to days of the week, which is why it is always indicated in the show the day and date, plus Saki's diary entry as an epilogue. Therefore, the entire story is one giant diary.


§§ Defending Its Slow Pace

So many people are complaining about the slow pacing, while here I am complaining that the anime is rushing the events of the novels. 

O blinded hearts! This kind of writing is just a glimpse of the type of writing that can be found in great literature. The light novels are not up to that standard (but so is everything else) but the writing reminds me of that slow, introspective style in great literature. In response to the people judging this piece of art negatively, I will have to judge such people as having poor taste in anime and movies and books.  

The bottom line is that the slow pace is by design. If everything in the light novels were to be animated and not rely on multiple uses of montage, this anime would have been at least 24 episodes. The point of this slow pace is that this will be an account of their boring, day-to-day living (the seikatsu in the title), and any romance that emerges will be organic compared to how romance is usually presented. 

The great thing about this anime is that the visuals and the musical score work together to create an overall vibe, and this vibe makes it feel that you're watching something extraordinary despite it being actually ordinary. For some people, nothing seems happening but the minutes pass by quickly thanks to the musick and visuals.

The light novels' point of view is Yuuta's, but it shifts in the anime, which relies more on show-don't tell. This is a romance drama. Unlike other dramas where there's an overdisplay of crying and angst, this one relies more on subtext. So the occasional voiceovers of Yuuta and Saki, especially Saki in her diary sequences, open the window to their feelings. 

Sometimes, either in close-ups or in medium shots, there are subtle facial expressions, especially in the eyes that clue you in on what Saki or Yuuta is feeling.

Given what we know, we have to carefully examine their action and infer their feelings at the moment. We must overcome our tendency to become passive consumers of media because this anime demands careful attention and even analysis. If you don't give it proper attention, I am judging you as having the attention span of a toddler. It's not the fault of the anime, it's your fault. 


§§ Not the Usual Stepsister Romance

If it's clear yet, this anime is not the usual stepsister romance. It's not trashy. It's not a romcom. 

Sure, those stepsister romances are enjoyable despite being trashy. But Days with My Stepsister is a story that goes beyond those usual stories. Having said that, I recommend that before watching Days with My Stepsister, one should watch either Domestic Girlfriend or My Stepmother's Daughter is My Ex or some other stepsister romance. 

Days with My Stepsister is a counterpoint to Domekano because the reality of stepsibling romance is addressed within the first minute of this anime. By being familiar with the usual tropes, you will appreciate the way Days with My Stepsister is going against the grain and what it is trying to do differently.

§ Themes

The anime opens in black and white, but as they pass each other, the world becomes coloured as though meeting each other is the start of the world moving from lifeless to colourful. Even though this is an aspect of cinematography, it mirrors how the theme is developed in this anime.

Both are depressed individuals and therefore view others with a cynical lens. They have this notion of becoming independent and not relying on other people. Whilst this is admirable in America, this is negative because 1) Japan is not individualistic but collectivistic, and 2) their underlying motivation is mentally unhealthy even in individualistic societies; they stem from trauma and their inherent mistrust of other people.

There's a wonderful progression in this anime from independence to interdependence, and this growth is wonderful to see whether they date or not.

It also touches on societal expectations and briefly drops some social commentary. But since this is romance, this anime did not continue with the social commentary and they don't need to. They were there to characterise these two as teenagers in the transition to adulthood. I may not agree with the content of what they said. (There are only two sexes!) But if you have not thought about these issues, you are essentially brain-dead. 

Let me note that conservatism in the Burkean sense is about holding traditions and norms as a source of knowledge on what's an optimal course of action. But as far as I'm concerned, there are traditions that are best kept and some traditions that ought to be rejected. 

How do we know? By doing what Saki and Yuuta are doing, which is to question the whys and wherefores of these traditions. It's much better to understand the rationale of why certain traditions are followed. You will appreciate the wisdom of your ancestors, but you will equally detest how wrong or inapplicable the received wisdom is in the context of today's world. 

Though minor, it also touches on mental health, and our one-true pair has mental health issues. It's not the main focus, but these issues affect how they deal with their feelings.


§§ A Reply to Some of the Most Inane Comments


1. Some people are under the mistaken notion that all art is political. They are most likely to like the social commentary made in Episode 2 but get disappointed that it did not continue with it. 

Newsflash: Some art can be political, but not all are political. It doesn't have to be political or offer social commentary all the time. It is the author's creation, and only he decides to make it political or not. You may disagree with it or not, but not appreciating what the author is trying to do and making a caricature of it based on what you would like the anime to be is the height of solipsism.


2. Some don't like the sombre tone of the anime and prefer the more light-hearted tone of the manga. 

Okay, we can allow for individual differences. After all, before the light novels, Days with My Stepsister is a series of short videos that are silly and conform more to the romcom genre: https://www.youtube.com/@gimai_seikatsu/videos.

But I prefer the sombre mood of the anime because it provides us a glimpse of teenagers who are somehow functional but feel the weight of the world on them. Their default state of mind is already messed up, and whatever conflicts they feel regarding their growing feelings for each other aggravate the weight these emotions have on them, and the satisfying conclusion would be for them to help each other carry the weight of their emotions.


3. This is also why I'm appalled at people who use the term 'nothing burger' or complain that nothing is happening or that some episodes are filler. Much of the drama is in the subtext. It seems that nothing is happening, but there's so much happening internally, and this is supported by the soundtrack and the visual elements.


4. The silliest criticism I've seen is Yuuta's generic design and complaining that the girls are not generic. They claim that Yuuta is made for self-insert purposes just like in many light novels. 

I agree that his design is generic but it is deliberately designed to be so. Yuuta described himself as average, and he seemed to be someone unlikely to attract a beauty like Saki. There's no requirement that Yuuta had to have a good character design; this doesn't prevent this anime from being great, despite your protestations. And by the way, the last time I checked, one anime with great character designs sucked big time.

Again, this criticism is really beside the point and is pretty much irrelevant. 

Now, let's get to the good part of this review on the musick and the visuals. 


§ The Perfect Combination of Soundtrack and the Visual Elements

As mentioned earlier, the musick together with the visuals creates the overall vibe.

( see this part of my earlier thread: https://x.com/patkarunungan/status/1834633868152078551 )


§§ Background Musick

All credit for this anime's incredible sound design goes to CITOCA.

This is the predominant background musick, and there are different variations of it used in the anime: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQG-wH0nUKg.

It is untitled. In the link above, it's titled New Family, but in this other cover, it is titled 新しい生活 (atarashii seikatsu) or new life: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tQuVLU5dVM

Assuming that it is supposed to mean 'new family,' it seems to be a nice, lovely song. It celebrates the new life of their parent's remarriage so that even the mundane things that they do, accompanied by this track, seem a compelling watch. 

It later acquires a painful meaning for a brief period, until it comes full circle in the final episode as the final variant is so much positive. I say this is brilliant. 

There's also this Lo-Fi study musick accompanied by a montage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zPudjnTojo.

This montage allows us to 1) see the wider world, 2) know what Saki is listening to, and 3) provide a natural break.


§§ The Visual Motifs

There are visual motifs that add to the subtext. Some of them function as pillow shots but acquire quite some meaning. They include the balloon, the hippopotamus, the hedgehog, mirror reflections, Saki's diary, and the fish tank. But there are others. 


1. The balloon represents Saki's childhood innocence that's there once but fleeting, and once gone, it's gone forever. It appeared as something out of place in Episode 1, but it is really prominent in the first diary sequence in Episode 3. It also appears in the prologue of Episode 8. 


2. The hippopotamus represents Saki's selfishness as a child. However, due to the financial difficulties that her mom had experienced, she repressed her selfish feelings. It appears for some reason in the last episode as she considers her conflicted feelings towards Yuuta. But the groundwork for this has been established in Episode 7, Episode 8, and Episode 9.  


3. Prof Kudou had a hedgehog puppet that she used to annoy Saki. mikawaghost先生 noted that Director Uena added this. It's an anime original, but he did not note that it alludes to the Hedgehog Dilemma, which is one of the themes of Neon Genesis Evangelion. 


4. Mirror reflections appeared in Episode 1, but they don't mean much until they mean so much in later episodes. The recurrence of such imagery seems to indicate that what the person is presenting to the world is different to what he or she is actually feeling inside. Again, this imagery adds so much subtext.


5. This is a big one, Saki's diary. This represents Saki's feelings and her private inner world, but this image is a stand-in for the entire anime. As mentioned above, the anime is one giant diary and each chapter is a diary entry.

I have to mention that there's a sound motif associated with the diary. It is titled 'Forbidden Love:' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn1osZRMo3Q


6. The fish tank is the most recurring. It initially served as a pillow shot, but it acquired a painful meaning at the end of Episode 9. Every appearance of this motif from Episode 10 is a reminder of something painful.

§§ In Defence of the Pillow Shots

I've been mentioning the term pillow shots quite liberally. It originates from the directorial style of Ozu Yasujirō, and it's quite common in anime. See this article: https://psychocinematography.com/2018/07/17/moments-of-cine-beauty-yasujiro-ozu-and-the-vase/

A number of people have complained that, instead of animating the reactions of Yuuta and Saki in a close-up using a shot-reverse shot, this anime chose to use a lingering pillow shot, one of which is the fish tank, and they count it as bad. Nothing could be further from the truth.

It's true that this anime did it to save some of the animation budget, but it is also done for artistic purposes, namely using the same techniques as Ozu. Again, I am appalled at their ignorance of such cinematic techniques.


§§ Cinematography

Thompson &amp; Bordwell in their book 'Film Art' define three cinematographic properties: 1) the photographic qualities of the shot, 2) the framing of the shot, and 3) the duration of the shot.

( See also my Notes for 義妹生活 Thread no 3: 🧵 Cinematography https://x.com/patkarunungan/status/1842937511724900410 

Part 2 of Thread no 3: https://x.com/patkarunungan/status/1842942450249433547 )


§§§ The Framing of the Shot

For no 2, the framing and the choices of close-up, medium, and long shots as well as variants, this aspect of cinematography in this anime isn't really special. It doesn't call attention to itself. There's basic mobile framing in that whenever a character moves horizontally, the camera for lack of a better word does a lateral tracking shot. Very basic. The camera barely moves. 

There are no fancy camera movements or fancy framing such as Dutch angles. It's just there to show their boring, day-to-day living.


§§§§ In Defence of the Faceless Drawings

When the characters appear in a long shot, more often than not, they have faceless drawings. Although this phenomenon appears in other anime such as Too Many Losing Heroines and The Elusive Samurai, this did not stop people from criticising this as 'lazy animation.' 

Indeed, they are doing this to save the animation budget, but there are artistic reasons. It gives the director the option of hiding the facial expressions of a character whenever needed. Also, to be fair, even in a long shot, they include the face when seeing the facial expression is absolutely necessary.

Finally, to show deep space, the background has to have fewer details than the foreground. If this is the purpose, then it makes sense in such situations to use faceless drawings. 


§§§ The Duration of the Shot

As for no 3, duration refers to long takes where a shot is held as much as possible before cutting to the next shot. In the usual long takes, the shot is usually 45 seconds or more, and usually, the camera tracks a certain character.

Compare this anime's use of long takes with this example from Citizen Kane: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gbgep7wF9w

This anime's long takes take place at a dinner table where the camera is static. It just captures a dinner conversation and feels really natural.

It's not as long as the long takes in classic films. It's just around 25 seconds, but for many anime watchers, it's an eternity. This is an indictment against the average anime viewer, if this is their criticism, because it only shows that their poor attention span makes them unable to handle something artistic.


§§§§ A Word on Phrenetic Editing

Some people don't like the use of long takes and prefer multiple short shots with quick editing. This gives it a frenetic and rushed feel, but it is not appropriate here. Moreover, this is what makes modern movies fall short of being cinematic. Such editing is one reason why Martin Scorsese criticises many modern movies and Marvel movies as 'not cinema.'

Isn't this offensive? These twats would rather make this anime not cinematic to make it conform to their philistine taste. No, thank you.


§§§ The Photographic Qualities of the Shot

This aspect of cinematography is where this anime shines.


§§§§ Aspect Ratio

I first noticed this technique of using different aspect ratios from kdramas starting in the year 2016. Yes, there are two examples where this anime used a higher aspect ratio. 

But this anime has chosen to use a lower aspect ratio, Standard Definition, in Saki's diary sequences to give this a retro feel. This also points to the fact that memories decay over time. Director Ueno took this aspect of directing from Jonas Mekas.


§§§§ Coloured Filter

This is useful for marking if something is a flashback or if something is a constructed image. Some flashbacks appear to be in watercolour-like quality or blue. Saki's imagination of seeing her mom and herself as part of the Asamura family in her childhood is marked by a white color filter. 


§ Conclusion

I had low expectations coming into this anime because it is made by Studio DEEN. Prior to Days with My Stepsister, Studio DEEN had a less-than-stellar reputation and their works are hit-or-miss. Fortunately, this is a hit, and this is all thanks to Director Ueno Souta. Perhaps this is the start of Studio DEEN's renaissance. 

This anime may have faults here and there, but overall, it's a masterpiece and I stand by it. It's not just cinematic because the anime is beautiful, but there are cinematically inspired shots that make it stand out. So much care, thought, and planning was given to create this anime. The overall impact negates any fault that some criticisms are beside the point.

Since there are several aspects of it to appreciate, this anime is worth analysing. There will be some aspects of my analysis that I might have missed, but this is what makes this anime so rewatchable. (Some details only become apparent upon a rewatch.)"
52481,537903.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Opinions in international anime groups have been many and often hard about this anime. It's so disgusting with siblings who develop feelings for each other,many cry out. I'd begin with saying most if not all those people probably haven't seen the series. They just read the title and have strong prejudices. Because this anime is about SO much more than siblings falling for each other. Both Saki and Yuuta are kids shaped by their upbringing, whereas while Yuuta grew up without a mother and Saki without a father. As children of single parents, they have had to get used to having only themselves to rely onand therefore find it difficult to accept help from others. But since they are both genuinely goodhearted behind the relatively high walls of reservation they have built around their broken souls, they slowly discover (much to their surprise) that they bring down each other's walls and both evoke feelings they both thought they were incapable of... Feelings they don't know how to handle, even less talk about...

This anime is about brokenness and healing. To slowly find yourself when you thought you were lost for good. It is a anime where often so little happens, but you still feel and experience so much. Many times all that happens is that inner thoughts are being heard, explained, questioned... Questions are asked - often without answers. All and everything accompanied by an unusually tasteful soundtrack that goes perfectly with the beautiful animation.

I won't reveal how things work out for Yuuta and Saki - I'll let you discover that for yourself - but I state that their inner journey is a real treat."
52481,537759.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"This anime feels so real, the camera angles were beautiful and they give me a sensation of loneliness and peace, animation was bettwr than most romance anime, the characters were so well written i didnt see any of them as just npcs trying to get the protagonist to reach his goal or tell his story, the fact that the parents play an important role in the development and decision in the story is refreshing, theyre 17 years old after all it adds to how genuine this feels. The development of character hooked me up, God i was even afraid they would never confess their feelings.I never write reviews but this anime is just amazing..it has been a long time an anime made me feel such strong emotions"
52481,537707.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"PLEASE... watch this anime. Give it a shot. I think the thing that is putting people off is the title, which is understandable. A show as great as this that tackles such interesting concepts deserves a better title. At the same time, though, maybe it doesn't. Maybe ""Days with My Stepsister"" with its simplistic title tells you exactly what you need to know about it. Simply put, if you are looking for a romance that is much more psychological and melancholic, this is the show for you. It tackles the moral dilemma of falling in love with a step-sibling and what that means for bothparties involved. Not only that, it delves into each person's past events and reasoning for why they feel the way they do in such a captivating and realistic way. This is in no way your standard romcom... but it will make you feel things. When sunlit days and rainy nights are given such a clear filter of realism, as they are in this, the joy and sadness you feel are all the more potent. These are the kinds of stories that I hope I will be able to create as clearly and beautifully in the future. 

Again, please give this show a shot. In my opinion as someone who has been around the block and seen a great deal of shows (especially romcoms and psychological ones) this is a masterclass of both. It's a truly refreshing take on these genres with a twist, and I think it excels in what it tries to say. This is easily the second best show of the season for me, only beaten by Monogatari Off &amp; Monster Season, of course. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. 

Thanks for reading, 
KingSkookum"
52481,537735.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"This is a good anime overall, but it is definitely not for everyone. First off, this anime is much more realistic in the viewpoint of a stepbrother and stepsister actually falling in love than many other anime. What this means is that the romance is a lot more slow and nuanced compared to something like ""Toradora!"" where there is more fast paced relationship growth and more of the typical embarrassed blushing romance that commonly happens in those animes. ""Days with My Stepsister"" however focuses much more on the childhood of the characters to the point of using it as an aid for backstory on the maincharacters and also using their graduation from high school as a point of decision for the teenagers with their growing up and need to find higher education for better jobs.

That isn't to say that I didn't find issues with this, actually I did. I found that this entire show moved so slowly, that it could probably be made into a compacted 6 episodes, or made into one movie. Which I believe this would've been better told as a movie, than that of a anime, but it is what it is.

If you are interested in a more realistic take on this romance, then I recommend it to you.
If you are not the type of person to sit through slow moving romance or dislike realistic relationships, then I would likely stay away.

7/10, Its good."
52481,539821.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Well this series was surprisingly good, especially after the slow pace of the series till the 8th ep or so, the production quality is not good but the director did a wonderful job covering for that weakness with its unique aesthetic in the important scenes, ingenious cuts and using filters to show us the audience what he wants to convey. The premise might just seem like a fetshisation of a romantic step-sibling relationship but it turned out to be a genuinely serious take on this dynamic and sometimes even a therapeutic experience at times. I can recommend this to anyone who wants a more unique takeon this kind of story."
57892,538445.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"One of the best story lines in isekai genre with MC getting revenge, unlike traditional story lines where there is a righteous man doing everything according to rule book and saving everyone from clutches, these follows a different route, where MC is ruthless, hardcore and goal oriented. I loved all the supporting characters in MC group, there are no irritating characters who trouble MC. If only they had a better budget for animation and stuff, this would have been great, i have to applaud the writer's imagination for creating such monsters, those are just absurd to look at. Finally, i enjoyed this a lot, I hopewe get to see season 2 with better animation. 
Total worthy anime, goes to my top isekai anime list easily."
57892,538503.0,1.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"I honestly think there are some anime out there who have some type of special qualities or abilities: failure frame (not gonna spell that long-ass name) is possibly one of the powerhouses in this regard with such a great ""what you see is what you get"". Every time our lovely protagonist yelled ""paralyze"" to the enemies, I, too, was paralyzed on sheer horror. Every ""poison"" made me feel uneasy too, and all his ""sleep"" made me slowly fall into a peaceful slumber, as if it were directed towards me instead of the character in the same series. Quite powerful anime, isn't it? Failure Frame isquite the case where the overly simplistic premise progresses so but so linearly and predictably that it becomes infuriating. No, I don't mean it's repetitive (though you'd be correct even in that case). It's just that it overuses the initial plot approach to the point of feeling silly. Stupid even. Failure Frame manages to live up to its name and premise, being quite a failure in almost every aspect.

But what is that makes Failure Frame such a case? What does it have? Well, let's start with a little review of the plot and how it starts:
Touka Mimori, our beloved protagonist, is on is way along with his classmates to some type of class trip in which- Wait what? Every one of his classmates is an absolute asshole? Yeah... Don't get too much good vibes from it... But I digress. So in the middle of the trip they got teleported to another world in which the goddess tells them that they're heroes and have skills and everyone is unique, and the bullies are strong and and and... Yeah, sorry for that, but basically that's your premise on the first episode. The plot itself present itself as such a bitter taste in your already bitter tongue that fall flat, why do I make this kinda of irony? Because I want to break down just how absolute horrible the first minutes of the anime are, we get to see how almost every one of Touka's classmates are absolutes assholes to others while having all the same type of ""hierarchy"" in class, I always tell to myself that this is the blandest way of trying to settle the tones, like what are you thinking? I don't know anybody and yet you force such a one-dimensional characterization on the WHOLE class and protagonist life just to make it easier to get edgy later? Couldn't you at least hope to wait just a little bit? And am I criticizing this part too much about something so simple? No. Not at all in this episode. The first moments of an anime is something that needs to make you feel engaged to it, that charms that it radiates via the characterization and dialogue that will settle our direction and setting on such works, but this is all we got for our first moment? And just don't make me start on how everyone turn on our protagonist to bully him because he is weak... See what I mean? It feels like all was just a pretext to make something look darker and tragic when it wasn't even organic on the first place, making it that the plot itself feels like something that tries just to fall onto the ground so hard it is almost shameful to look at.

Going back to the main point: the first episode is absolutely horrible, no questions asked. But it’s in the following episodes that you'll be subjected to what you'll hear throughout the entire series. Yes, be prepared for the unbearable, insipid, excruciating, and nightmarish... Paralyze and poison... It seems as I'm doing some kinda of joke now, but seriously, this is what I mean in my first point: Failure Frame: I Became the Strongest and Annihilated Everything With Low-Level Spells, focus in where it says ""annihilated everything with LOW-LEVEL SPELLS"" because this is a point in where I think we need focus. You see, there's plenty of people of anime (isekai specially) in which the only gimmick is that the protagonist have one thing, let it be quality or skill, that almost runs all his character trying to maintain it afloat. There was an anime in which the protagonist was overly cautious, which I liked, and another one in which the main gimmick is that the protagonist can parry everything which I'm not liking (from this same season), and other in which the protagonist is a middle-aged adventurer (also from this season) that I think is okay... So what's the difference? Obviously, and for starters, it's the direction and how serious the series want to be versus how serious it actually is.

If your protagonist have an overpowered or just silly skill, make it that his personality and plot points doesn't wrap around it.

If your protagonist have a silly exaggerated quality, make it that the series itself can have humor and even teases itself.

But, for the sake of everything that is holy, don’t make your protagonist rely solely on their skill, and even more so, don’t treat it too seriously. At least give us a chance to laugh at the end of the day. What Failure Frame did was the latter. Obviously, this reflects my preferences regarding how a character's personality should align with their skill. I think that what’s most annoying about Touka lies there. It’s not just that; his character almost literally works as an oxymoron for the plot itself.

Now let me try to extend on this little silly idea. You see, the plot enriches itself with the idea of how the protagonist was ranked as a bad hero and how he wasn't even capable of doing anything spectacular, so they decided to send him to a dungeon in where the sunlight don't even peek out contrasted with all the monsters that do peek out to kill and eat, that's known to us thanks to the goddess Vicious, the main antagonist, but there's some question that arise after watching some episodes... First, why send heroes there in the first place? I know it is focused the point that Touka is really bottom of the barrel and talentless... But still, why? This question arise also from the lack of deep and exposition of how the magic and power systems works. Even if it's true that Touka tried to paralyze Vicious to just fall miserably, there's no explanation in how does the effect of paralyze and poison work, neither of how the curve of that power itself work, isn't Vicious just wasting potential like a fool? We just need to take in our minds that it seems that paralyze and poison works on some people and not on others, but doesn't that make Touka almost extremely broken? Add to it the fact the poison and paralyze almost never or straight never goes off the creatures once the skill is leveled up, so it was a little more of training and the protagonist have the power to quite literally kill everyone slowly as he imprisons them. Again, Vicious, aren't kinda of a big fool for wasting this potential? That's one first problem, and why don't use that dungeon as a place for the heroes to train? Doesn't that seems more worth than just doing those stupid errands and expeditions that we see throughout the episodes whose serve no purpose to be honest. The fact that something so simple like paralyze and poison have such a big impact makes it hard to believe the rules bound towards strong hierarchy and the antagonist mentality, as I said, is all forced to make the story edgy and makes our protagonist suffer, because that's the point, to try to be serious yet not being serious, just like as I stated on my first point.

That also followed my second point too: How absurdly linear and predictable the plot progress just based on the approach it takes at the start. When I meant that I wasn't focusing on this series being generic, is that I mean that the tittle says it all about the anime both in progression and content; I usually think there's a misconception when you talk about something being repetitive by following the same structure yet having different content in each structure, than having the same content with different structure in the narrative, both of them don't mean anything bad by itself, but that's a whole another talk and I digress. My point about Failure Frame falls into that, how it does the same thing again and again both in the same content and with the same narrative structure and even plot points, which I find almost inconceivable in any media. That problem of falling on the same structure and content falls because, well, the protagonist have the same skills, I remember when I was a kid I wondered plenty of times ""Hey! Why doesn't Goku just spams Kamehameha to defeat his enemies with no problem?"" well, little me, it's because that would be fucking boring, so damn boring that no one would think about making a story like that, right...? Sorry my inner kid, your words were heard by a japanese man, whose name is Shinozaki Kaori. But yeah, that's the problem, the content itself is limited when talking about actions sequences and conflicts, because the protagonist has only 2 skills that he spams... Then what about the content? Let me break it down for you:

—""Please please don't kill me! I-I don't know anything...""- Touka, in almost every circumstance

—""Hehe... It seems we have quite the easy target... Hehe...""- The enemies, which proceed to talk with themselves like idiots

—""Haha morons you've fallen for my trap RHHAAAAA PARALYZE POISON!!!""- Touka, who just killed the treat of today's episode

The reason as to why I took my tame to wrote such a lame and cringeworthy set of words is because that's the stamp, the golden print, of this anime. Failure Frame somehow thinks its interesting seeing this, even faking a build up to its reader. Like, what do you mean the strongest character showed died because he was careless? And on top of that, he was careless because the protagonist told him ""Hmm... Well if you come later to me, I'll be stronger, so we will have a great showdown and yeah..."" what type of poor dialogue is that? This is not any type of subverting expectations to make an interesting plot twist nor to change the narrative, this is just a failed promise by the author, almost betraying the setup he made himself by sacrificing dialogues and a character's conflict, just so the protagonist can go ""paralyze - poison - sleep - berserk""? That happens in a specific character to which I even made pasta, which for me is the nectar of life, just for it to get completely spoiled after witnessing such a horrible episode. Both in structure and content, there's no grace in this.

And that’s just the surface, because Failure Frame is full of surprises—or maybe not. There’s a saying in my country, 'Chiste repetido sale podrido,' which means that something repeated too often becomes lame. That’s the experience with Failure Frame; it’s kind of funny, considering that even after everything, I haven’t even started talking about the characters. But there lies the problems, there's really a few to talk about when it comes to characters, because if the main core, the plot and world have deep issues, how are we supposed to look in good eyes at the characters on the world? The character, funnily enough, feels really disconnected from the world they live in, maybe because of how the info dumping works in the series, in which every dialogue is fueled with edginess that is not even funny, so the inclusion of the characters on the main plot and the world fitting around them is so dissonant contrasted by the tones and direction it feels like a lazy attempt instead of characters really talking about themselves, that's specially true in the main duo's dynamic; Touka and Seras.

There's a scene I would use to make an attempt to disclosure just how silly this relationship feels; In a moment they're asking a receptionist for a room, to which the conversation goes like this ""Touka, I think we should order just one room to save money"" to which Touka replies with ""Do you know I am a man, right?"" to which Seras blushes and stutters, while Touka just keep his Stoic demeanor... And later at that same episode there's a mistake for Sera's part in which she serves Touka herb that turns him on, to which Seras says ""Is there any way I can help you?"" and at that point I was done, how could it be that Touka and Seras relationship makes progress based on that stupid tension? I'm saying it because a few episodes before that happens, there is one episode that finishes with Touka literally asking Seras ""Hey, remove your clothes"". Is when you gather all those dialogue when you notice Seras and Touka's relationship was settled since the beginning for the author, so he just made some lazy plot points for it to make it more sense for them to be together; he changed the order of the things, he thought first on the idea of making a partner for the protagonist, he thought too much into that, making all their interactions later are based on some type of fetishistic things related to the fact that Touka is the one who saved her. So no, the characters doesn't even feel like characters, the main duo isn't even charming in the slightest, and they don't have chemistry whatsoever and their dialogue fall flat, even with all the conflict that Seras had at the start and how Touka helped her they still both feel like their dynamic is artificial and with a dialogue so unsubstantial and so shamelessly insinuate that doesn't even work as irony nor parody, not like that was the author's intention tho.

Now... Stay with me in this one, even if it's true that the source material from this anime is anything but good, there are some guilty people here making this stuff. You know, the charm of this is seen how they ANIMATE the source material into. If luckily, a whole different experience still aligned with the original themes and essence, right? Sometimes I feel like I talk to myself. Now is one of those moments, because this anime looks awful, but goddamn awful. The animation lack in almost every department, but the worst and more nightmarish prize should be given to Kōtarō Sasaki, having worked previously on... Tesla Note?! Don't worry, he wasn't managing the CGI back then, but it seems so, as both look so bad that it even breaks the immersion in the series to an absurd level, I won't even give examples in episodes that looked back, just search the opening on YouTube and enjoy. I'm full into appreciating CGI, the stigma is not bad at all compared to how was it back then on 2016, but there are some art choices that just doesn't seem to make sense on my head. There are plenty of scenes in which the CGI of our main duo walks in the middle of a dark forest, making an abrupt change between traditional animation to CGI while having such dark backgrounds make it look awkward, as its like the whole focus artistically changes with no reason from one point to another... I obviously don't want to insult Kōtarō Sasaki, the budget didn't seem to good for this anime neither, yet I can't help but think that the anime would have look so much better without that nasty CGI and those sudden changes in shots that also changes the animation style with no advent just to follow the same narrative, making is unnecessary and awkward. Sasaki's CGI just doesn't work along with Yōko Nakao's decisions. Its normal, since it is really hard to include CGI in anime like that. But if that was the case since the start they should have not done it in the first place... Yet I'm not expert on animation whatsoever. But if I, the public, see those mistakes, is because something wrong is going on there, the general composition of the series looks awful and sometimes even slow, but at least it feels coherent, unlike some anime from this same season, so that's a little bonus for it.

So, what does Failure Frame attempt to achieve in its final stretch, or in its subversion of the tropes it has been playing with throughout the series? It's a bit funny. Failure Frame tries to impose limitations on the protagonist simplistic powers, but it ends up with strange results. For instance, there's a moment where the protagonist reaches a maximum number of targets, and in another case, he attempts to paralyze an enemy, but it fails because... the enemy covered their face? It feels weird and nonsensical, and there's no narrative explanation as to why that would happen.

Additionally, why tell us he has reached the maximum number of targets, only for him to paralyze everyone again moments later? It feels like a lazy attempt by the author to remind us, 'Oh, remember, this power isn't all that great... but yeah, it still works.' This inconsistency adds to how strange the world feels. Why is this skill portrayed as a weak, extra ability when the series has shown and told us two different things about it? When the premise is delivered so inconsistently, with basic elements far apart like two separate lines that should align, it becomes clear that the plot wasn’t fully thought through.

One of the most frustrating aspects of this adaptation is how little progress the series makes on the central plot established at the beginning. We barely see the protagonist’s journey toward vengeance—it’s as if they bait us with it, only to let it sink. I understand that this is likely due to what the first season is meant to adapt, but since there's almost no chance of a second season (and I honestly hope there isn't one), this feels awkward and almost dishonest. The series spends so much time with the protagonist shouting, 'Vicious, I’m going to get my revenge,' that any other plot progression feels unimportant and uninteresting. Along the way, he recruits characters who are flat and boring, serving only to highlight how terrible the world is. If you're writing a dark fantasy and the only way to show the darkness of the world is through repetitive dialogue and grotesque characters, then the world feels one-dimensional and weak. That’s when you know you fucked it up.

There are countless other bad things to be said about this series, many of which make me feel as furious as the characters themselves. The blandness of the characters—both in their dialogues and personalities—is so infuriating and laughable that you can’t watch any scene involving Touka’s class interacting without asking yourself 'why?' with an awkward smirk. Delving further into it almost feels redundant. Characters introduce themselves, only for none of them to have any real relevance in the anime. The awkward and jarring transitions between CGI and traditional animation don’t help, especially when the environment looks poorly rendered. The worldbuilding is equally awful, with a weak power system, and the main cast adds nothing to the story. There’s no excitement or intrigue for what’s next—it’s just a disappointing mess. 
So Failure Frame really did it great, because:

The plot paralyzed me in horror.

The characters drove me berserk with how annoying they are.

The animation poisoned me for life.

Save yourself from this"
57892,538489.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Failure Frame is an interesting one for me. A Fantasy Isekai show, it's incredibly derivative in it's ideas and execution, has some absolutely horrendous 3D scene transitional animation that breaks any immersion whatsoever, laughable caricature villain antagonists (You don't have to like all your classmates, but come on!), but despite all that, I dunno, the show was still kinda fun this time *shrugs*... Friday mid-morning, come home after milking my cows and then proceed to chuck on an episode of Failure Frame. Goddamn, Friday was a great day for seasonal anime this time around. Failure Frame in the morning, palette cleanser Giji Harem in theevening right after some odd farm jobs, and then finish it off with the ""sophisticated"" Gimai Seikatsu, almost feel like I have to dress up nicely for that one, a glass of white wine to accompany. But enough of that, so what exactly did I enjoy about this show?

Well, the character design was top notch, both the main cast and the endless masses of monsters. Touko Mimori, our main MC, does have that usual stock Light Novel look about him, but I'll tell you, making the character look slightly more mature/masculine and without the squeaky voice of a boy yet to hit puberty, works fucking wonders. It's complimented by the way he generally acts as well, a very careful, meticulous character who doesn't scream or overreact at every damn thing, he's not really angry edgy either, just incredibly focused at the job/goal at hand, yet still cares and shows some compassion for his companions.

Seras Ashrain, the main Female MC, might just be the hottest elf I've ever seen in anime. Well done to the artist who struck gold with this one, you did good. She kind of falls under the usual ""falls in love with the main guy"" trope after certain circumstances, but it still takes time to develop, it's not fucking immediate like so many other shows. A gorgeous badass elf, not much to hate here. 

Now, I am a huge sucker for cosmic horror types of creatures and atmospheres, and some of these monstrosities definitely left me thinking ""what the actual fuck"" or ""that's a lot of eyeballs"" when they appeared on screen. Part of it was also thanks to the ghastly 3DCGI work lol, but it made them stick out even more, some really cool and creepy looking designs, the last time I remember being so awed by monsters was while watching Gantz:O. It'll never get old for me, no matter how many similar disturbing designs I come across. This show was a lot more grittier and darker in tone than what I anticipated it to be. 

Make no mistake, the MC is extremely OP and proceeds to use his skills with little resistance throughout the show and it's a revenge driven narrative. It's not something like My Instant Death Ability Is Overpowered where Bro utters ""shine "" (die) after an unfunny, confident tirade from the antagonist, the girl chirping in afterwards to make a straight man joke, rinse and repeat till it's over, in Failure Frame the MC is cunning and ruthless and there's not much forced comedy element to his unstoppable killing spree (the way he sometimes fakes out people can be amusing), it's all introspective and analytical as he walks his path towards his goals. 

I can scarcely believe it, but I even kind of want to check out the Light Novel after finishing this, which is something I never fucking wanna do after finishing a similar themed anime. There's also that longing, ever present tease of when is he gonna finally reveal himself to others from his own world/the goddess, etc, that sort of satisfactory viewing you can only get through certain situations. It's all very manipulative in it's boyish qualities, but I guess these elements just play greatly to that kid in myself.

Overall, it was the main characters and the dark, brooding ambience of the show that kept this show afloat for me, not sure I'd recommend it overall unless you enjoy these sorts of tropes specifically, maybe have a go at the source material, which is what I am planning on doing in the near future."
57892,538696.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Among all the action anime on my watchlist this Summer of 2024, this one is a guilty pleasure. It may be tropey but it scratches the itch left by 'Redo of Healer.' Here's the synopsis: Our main character Mimori Touka along with his classmates was on a school trip. But the bus they were on was magically transported to another world thanks to the goddess Vicius. Everyone in the class had powers, which Vicius would use for whatever purpose, but Touka had the weakest. He was left on a chambre to die, but he survived. He gets by with low-level skills but he was able tolevel them up to the point that he is so strong. Basically, this is a revenge story, not just against the goddess Vicius who is the main antagonist but also against his schoolmates who bullied him. 

What should be clear by now is that there is nothing unique here. In fact, these tropes were parodied earlier this year in 'My Instant Death Ability Is So Overpowered, No One in This Other World Stands a Chance Against Me!'

It doesn't help that the animation especially the CGI is subpar. Many people are bothered by it, but not me. Here's why.

The story is half-decent and is my greatest guilty pleasure. The angst of the main character is relatable. Who wouldn't want to take vengeance against people who looked down on you? In all the episodes, it managed to be really entertaining.

His three female companions are interesting. Seras Ashrain, the most desirable woman in that world, is a great sword wielder. She is more than her looks. Another companion is the gladiator, Eve Speed. She has great physical strength. And finally Lisbeth. Born as a slave, she might prove to be an interesting character down the road. 

But here's another potential downside. The world of this anime is vast. It could have been explored really well if this were a long-running, battle shounen. A great example would be the coliseum arc. It could have been at least 5 great episodes. 

But alas! The author and the anime studio had to choose scenarios that are good enough but you are left wondering if the other choices are more compelling.

I like it and therefore recommend it, but be mindful that it doesn't have the best animation available."
57892,538567.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"If I had to summarize my thoughts in one sentence, it would be: This anime fucking sucks, I got mild enjoyment out of it. Ohh boyy this will be a short one, thank god. The Good: It's a cheap revenge porn ahh isekai. The MC is logical, calculating, merciless, and extremely goal oriented. The side characters are a nice touch, nice chemistry between them, none of them are annoying retards that and make me want to castrate myself. The plot is barebones, but it works; the pacing in on point. The Bad: The anime is so hideous, it actually made me want to skip the 'fight'scenes. The monster designs might look great on a manga panel, but it looks absolutely dogshit in CGI form. The MC is absolutely OP in the worst way possible, fights are ended in a couple words, regardless of the opponent, 0 stakes. Edgy, cringey, generic dialogue, that make me question life.

This is the type of shit you watch if u have absolutely nothing else to watch and need to scratch the isekai craving itch (me). Failure Frame is bad in nearly every way, but something about it just works. Watch the first couple eps and decide for yourself."
57892,538802.0,3.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"I am honestly a bit surprised how much hype I have been hearing about this as it entered into its final weeks of airing. From the start with this anime, I absolutely loathed this one. The first episode showed some promise. It has every Isekai trope in the book, but it made for an entertaining setup. After that is when it really lost its main redeeming element. It’s animation. Budgetary reason or not, the 3D animated models looked dismal, there’s no other way to slice it. To make matters worse it switched so rapidly between the 2D and 3D animation that it made the poor visualslook even worse. 

That is what the problem was. The story was too much like “From Commonplace to World’s Strongest” to where why wouldnt’ you just watch that, or it’s many similar shows. The writers had no ideas. No example more clear than every villain was the exact same. Just some absolute scumbag always verbally assaulting whatever women are around. It’s insane. 

Overall, I just can’t recommend this one. I understand people like me love Isekai, but I have to draw a line somewhere. There are just way too many similar shows to this that execute so much better than this."
57892,539438.0,3.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"This anime had so much potential, but wow, it really dropped the ball. The story itself is somewhat unique, but it can be predictable at times. While I usually enjoy this genre and setup, the execution here really dragged it down. As for the art style, it doesn’t fit the story at all. The CGI is just plain awful, and the random switches to 3D animation are super confusing, which totally kills the vibe! The characters are another weak point. While they have some interesting traits, they often come off as flat, lacking the depth needed to feel well-rounded. They have strengths and weaknesses, but theyalso veer into being unusually strong or stupid at times, which feels unrealistic.

Speaking of realism, the characters’ reactions to events often feel off. Instead of being relatable, their responses can come across as forced or exaggerated, which doesn’t help immerse you in the story.

As for whether others might enjoy this series, I think some people might still find it appealing due to the genre and the basic premise. However, for viewers looking for depth and solid execution, they might feel disappointed like I did. If you don’t want a headache, just read the manga instead—it’s way better!"
57892,538941.0,4.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"This is one of those trash isekai that I enjoyed watching as mindless entertainment, but it is unquestionably a bad anime. There was a time in anime when people used the three episode rule before deciding if a series was good or not, these days you can generally tell just after the first episode. But I also put it to you that the OP also tells you a huge amount about the series. The OP sets the tone, it tells you what the studio thought was important to focus on, and how they want to present the series. More than that, a great OP where the studio hasput in time and care, usually means the series itself is going to be good.
A generic average OP pretty much is always tied to a generic average series
And a bad OP is a bad sign, because if the studio couldn't even put any effort into the OP, then you know the series will also be bad.
In just 2-3 minutes the OP allows you to set your expectations for what the series has in stall for you.
 
With Failure Frame, the OP tells you all you need to know about this series, of cause the problem is like a lot of anime these days, the OP is used as the ED of the first episode.
A class of students are Isekai'd, one student is separated from the others and is in a cave where he faces a horde of monsters alone, the other students are off training, while he meets a blonde elf girl and forms a party with other fantasy world characters from the fantasy world.
It has terrible animation, using that oversaturation and halo effect that is the anime equivalent to the lens flare, it doesn't look good especially when it is overused, bad CG, and yes, this is all featured in the OP

Without even going into the plot in any detail, it should sound familiar to anyone who watches isekai, these tropes have been done before, but most famously by Arifureta, the problem is Arifureta is better in almost every single way, and yes, even down to its bad CG, because even though Arifureta also has bad animation and bad CG, it isn't used constantly, 50% of Failure Frame uses bad CG, even in scenes where you would expect regular animation.
The only reason I give this the same score I gave Arifureta is because Arifureta S1 was badly paced and a bad adaptation. I can't judge this as an adaptation, but the pacing doesn't seem that bad.

Another issue is that it takes itself too seriously, so it isn't as fun as it could be, it is still fairly over the top in places, which is why I call it mindless fun, but there are better series out there for just pure enjoyment.
However watching the MC kill everything in sight in these types of anime is never boring, it's why trash Isekai will always be my guilty pleasure.
This is one that is only for fans of trash Isekai, otherwise avoid it like the plague."
57892,538545.0,5.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Hazurewaku is a bare bones isekai, with little to nothing going for it. It will jar you in a way no anime should, that being with its CG animation, used for both characters and monsters, at random. When it doesn't use CG, it's just fine. Unfortunately, the premise is the most interesting part of the anime, and the rest of the 11 episodes are largely uneventful, with no spots worthy of mentioning. Even the 12 episode is so nonchalant about things, that I pondered if there is a 13th episode to finish this season...there isn't apparently. This series is justanother anime with 0 passion.  These types of anime are so common these days now, it's getting annoying.  The team working on this are just there for a pay cheque, and it's clear.

Animation 6/10
-  The CGI is tolerable on monsters, but god awful when used for characters...I don't get it, it's just lazy.
Sound 6/10
-  I don't score sound poorly often, as most shows do enough, which this show does.  There is nothing extraordinary about anything in its sound design, the OP is bad, the ED is good.
Story 4/10
-  Good isekai premise, but bad execution from episode 2 on.  The protagonist levels up by using the same move set every time, and it's just braindead story telling.
Characters 5/10
-  I like Seras.
Enjoyment 6/10
-  I didn't hate it, I didn't like it, but I watched it.

This anime had potential from the get-go, but I can't see it getting any better.  I can't in good faith tell others to waste their life force on this."
57892,538535.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Failure Frame has a decent story, but it’s held back by bad CGI, too much fanservice, and an underdeveloped plot. That said, I actually found it pretty enjoyable overall, and I think it’s a bit misunderstood. The problems don’t make it bad—they just pile up and take away from what could’ve been a great show. Firstly, I liked the twist on the usual reincarnation theme, where the protagonist gets betrayed by a goddess. It’s not the most original take, but it was still a nice change of pace for an isekai series. Now, onto the visuals—this is where things get messy. The animation quality is all overthe place. The first episode looks solid, but then episodes 2-5 hit you with some terrible CGI. And it’s not even for big action scenes; they use it for basic stuff like talking around a bed or walking through town. It feels weird and unnatural, with characters suddenly moving in smooth 3D animation, then snapping back to 2D. Luckily, after episode 5, the show mostly sticks to 2D animation for the rest of the season, which is a welcome improvement, but when 3D animation is used later in the season, it looks much better than what it was in the early episodes, but still, I wish it was not used.

The fight scenes are quite mediocre, most of them don't make sense for Touka to fight in them the way he does. This isn't to say that they all are stupid, some are actually well thought out, but it doesn't help when most of the enemies are CGI.

When it comes to the characters, they’re pretty cliche, but not in a bad way. The main character, Touka, is actually decent. He’s got a personality, and he’s not as clueless as your typical isekai protagonist. He goes through some solid development throughout the series, and I ended up liking him more than I expected. Seras, on the other hand, feels more like fan-service than an actual character a good portion of the time. She’s often just there to look embarrassed or show some skin, which gets old fast. But, when the show isn’t focusing on that, she’s alright, but they don’t give her much depth besides her affection of Touka.

6.5/10, I recommend it. The anime isn’t bad, and its story can be fun to follow. However, you’ll need to overlook the inconsistent CGI and some underdeveloped plot points. If you can switch off your brain and focus on the story, it’s an enjoyable watch within the isekai genre."
57892,538679.0,2.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"What if the weakest guy was actually the strongest? What if the least cool loser became the strongest due to his special ability? What if they made Arifureta again? Weakest Hero with Low-Tier Shitty Skills answers those questions. And also answers: What if Arifureta had even worse CGI? What if Arifureta had an even uglier color palette? What if Arifureta was just, like, overall less fun? This is one of the most self-indulgent isekai LN adaptations ever produced. An absolutely unironic entry in a genre that’s impossible to take seriously. And (for a minute) almost beat for beat an Arifureta clone. The MC’s whole class is isekaied (like inArifureta), and his goal is to kill a god (like in Arifureta), who was… mean to him and also tried to kill him by sending him to the depths of a dungeon (like in Arifureta), but then he finds out how to use his powers and levels up a whole bunch (like in Arifureta), then he finds a hot blond woman who wants to fuck him (like in Arifureta), etc. etc.

Unlike Arifureta, the MC’s entire class is evil murderers, not just a couple of jerks. Except for three hot girls (who will presumably join bro’s harem at some point).

It does diverge from the Arifureta once we leave the dungeon, but after that the whole plot is just edgy isekai boilerplate. There’s no levity, it has this boring, dark tone throughout.

The show is awash in bizarre technical errors. Even leaving the atrocious visuals aside, the audio sucks. There’s one point in episode five (at about 8:13) where the audio levels randomly spike. I have no idea how that stayed in, that’s a mistake I’d be surprised to see an eleven-year-old with a YouTube channel make, let alone a whole ass anime studio.

The protagonist is annoying as hell. He has an obnoxious habit of monologuing his plans to villains before killing them, he’s always a million steps ahead of everyone. His ability is essentially an instakill button, the only activation condition being that his enemy needs to be within range. When that’s how fights work, not even playing the opening can make them hype.

The direction in some fights makes absolutely no sense. Since the MC’s ability depends on people being in range, the top directorial priority should be making the distance between him and his enemy clear. But no, in one pivotal scene his enemy seems to move away from him, then MC goes “they’re in range” and instakills them with the instakill button.

When it comes to insane moments… there are a few. At one point there’s this big important meeting, and all the participants have big important names (that show up on title cards for half a second). One of those names is: Falkendotzine Miradiasordzit.

The way this show does exposition is hilarious. In this one scene the protagonists overhear rumors about a cult in a bar, then they discuss the rumors, then a group of evil-looking hooded men enter and say “we are the evil magic cult”. Like bro we got it from the hoods you don’t need to announce yourselves.

I could list off more of these moments, but that discussion could easily veer into spoiler territory, and doing so may give the false impression this show is more interesting than it actually is.

So… don’t watch it. Unless you have the same exact type of isekai brain poisoning I do… but if that’s the case, you've already watched it.

Uh… if you want to watch joyless Arifureta… this is the show for you!"
57892,538444.0,6.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Failure Frame is a rather apt title for this series because it is a failure on nearly every level. This is an affront to everything holy about this medium. Poor and edgy writing for the sake of being edgy, the worst production values of the year and an inferior version of Arifureta’s premise. I mean seriously, it’s one thing to have a generic revenge story set up, it’s another to have horrible production quality with it. Like pick a struggle. This was bad and really the only redeeming quality it had was Seras, who funny enough was my only reason for being interested in theLight Novels as well when I’d see them in the store. Unless you just want to see some really awful animation or for some God forsaken reason enjoy rapey characters, this is one you can safely pass on.

There’s no nice way to say it, this was rough. Failure Frame started out halfway decent with the whole class being summoned gimmick and character designs that looked pretty good, but about halfway through episode 1 I knew this was going to be a disaster. When the staff can’t even be bothered to not make the OP CGI, you know it’s ass. Admittedly, I do kind of like the story. Like if this didn’t have all the rapey villains, the poor animation, and awful action scenes I would have probably enjoyed it. Yea, it’s a basic ass cookie cutter revenge fantasy, but I am always partial to stories where the class is summoned. Arifureta, Kumo desu, etc. The difference is, those stories(in the books anyway) took their time showing you the character’s growth and them overcoming obstacles, had really good world building and more. Failure Frame lacked in all those respects. Like yea, Tooka gets screwed over and wants revenge on the goddess cool, but I still don’t understand how he goes from being a loser at the start to this gigachad master tactician edgelord  by the end of the season. It felt like a cliff notes version of the story, which is sadly the case for a lot of LN adaptations so nothing new there. But if you’re gonna have a weak development arc you can’t have weak production too.

That brings me to the other big issue here, the author’s over reliance on sexual assault to characterise bad guys as bad. It’s such a cheap and overdone trope. Does rape happen? Obviously. Was the Middle Ages sadly a much more dangerous spot for women? Yes. But we really don’t need every villain to want to rape the main female lead or make observations about her body being “slutty”. Like even Vinland saga which takes place during the medieval ages did not have many instances of sexual assault. We get it after one time man you don’t need to keep going back to that well. It just made it hard to take many of the villains seriously because they’re so obviously cartoonishly evil. I like my villains with a little bit of actual writing other than just doing disgusting stuff that appalls me. When I say this was common I mean it was REALLY common. Like every antagonist save 1 in this cour mentions it or is hinted to be involved in that type of thing, it just made me not care about the conflicts to be honest. I do think the goddess is an interesting antagonist and there’s a mystery about why she does what she does, who’s pulling her strings etc., that hangs over her for the entire season. 

 Production wise like I said this show looks bad. Seven arcs ruined chained soldier and they did the same here. Using CG to animate standing and still character models is certainly one of the creative choices of all time. There was just way too much unnecessary CGI. I can see it being used in action scenes with monsters, but come on, if you can’t be bothered to draw characters standing around in a supposed 2D anime show, that’s bad. This is really a 2.5D show just because of the sheer number of times we see 3D.

So what’s the verdict? I’d say this is a rather easy skip. It’s a story we’ve seen done better elsewhere with horrible production qualities. Seras is great, but if you’re interested in her I think the books are the way to go. I do have the first few volumes because I love the art style and have been seeing them for so long in the bookstore that I couldn’t resist. I hope the actual story is a lot better done there than the anime, because this was not it at all. Hard pass. 

Failure Frame gets 6 out of 10."
57892,539417.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"I don't know why nowadays anime is made too simple, for example like this anime, almost all of it is made using CGI, it feels like watching a cut scene from a video game. From the beginning to episode 6, I think this anime is still quite enjoyable. Even though at first I wanted to recommend it, over time this anime lost its appeal, most anime are like this, when they reach the end of the episode, There are always useless things to extend the broadcast duration. For example, in episode 7 and onwards, who knows what happened, this anime became more about chatting than progressing the storyline.I was so bored watching this, that I had to skip some of the unnecessary chat scenes to get to the main story.

Let's skip the bad parts, I commend the voice actors who did a great job on this anime.
The voice acting here is very good, especially the MC who sounds intimidating, but unfortunately the anime is not as good as expected.
If this anime was filled with soft voice actors, I don't know, maybe the result would be worse than now."
57892,539044.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"This anime is one of those where you wonder: where did the budget go? The story had the potential to be at least a decent story. Within the already overexploited isekai genre, it is appreciated when the protagonist is not just the most powerful being in the world. The abilities are interesting to explore and see the ingenuity of the protagonist to use such limited abilities. Our protagonist plays the role of support or debuffer, so, even though he can fight alone, his power shines more in team fights. So that characters join the protagonist's team makes sense and he is not just going around gatheringa harem just because he can. The team is also varied, we have the one who will be the pretty face of the anime but it is also appreciated that they made a proper beast woman and not just a girl with cat ears. In the character design section there is not much to complain about.

In the animation section, personally I am not against CGI but as long as it is used well. Here it seemed like they had a CGI quota to fill. Sometimes the CGI was used in the most unnecessary scenes possible. The monsters looked strange and not in a good way. They had clumsy movements, felt slow and did not represent a threat, as they looked a bit silly instead of imposing. And you could understand saving the budget for an epic final scene where the protagonist and his team would fight until they dropped, but that was not the case either. When we get to the climax of the story and you think you're going to see a decent display of animation, you are given the most bland scene seen in the entire season. When it ends you end up wondering if there was ever a budget for this anime.

If you are a fan of isekais you will most likely watch this anyway because nothing will stop you. If you are looking for a fresh story within the genre, just keep in mind that you could find it here. Although really, it ended up being just another story in the pile."
57892,538453.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"A typical revenge isekai executed poorly. Begins to fall apart after episode 2. Flat on its face after ep3 or so. Characters: Hard to get too invested in the characters the way they are presented, even the MC. Character design: Character design is pretty average overall, but the familiars are just plain stupid, and not in an endearing way. That one that gets wheel legs when enlarged... WTF... just embarrassing. I'd say the familiars were deigned by a 10-year old if I didn't know some talented young artists that could far exceed these designs. Animation: Sometimes the 2D animation is okay, but makes heavy useof jarring GCI throughout, static lighting on model textures, etc., etc. No thanks.

Story:
Nothing special.  Guy gets wronged, becomes OP, looks for revenge.  Takes on typical good guy doing bad things role.  Supporting cast is cliché at best with nothing to really draw you into their strife or cheer them on.  No emotional investment.  No intellectual investment. Just flat.

Music:
Terrible. Musical scores are just wrong, no cohesion.  They tend to take you out of the moment rather then help immerse you into it.

They did the best they could with what they were given.  Can't really fault them for the failures of this show."

While we got another title in the Isekai world, this series dives in a deeper, darker direction. The MC is immediately tossed for being ""useless,"" like any other common comeback trope, and he rises from the ashes to shine like a formidable fire. Truthfully, the story of this Anime is good, better than most if anything. It does not sugarcoat the cold cruel reality of how reincarnating in another world isn't all fun and games. People can die, and the variety of nightmare-designed monsters is proof of it. Like many others,I agree the 3DCG has prevented Hazurewaku from being a top contender for the Isekai genre. The disparity is so vast, that you could even compare it to oil and water. That's how bizarre the 3DCG is, this could have been resolved if there was more time or budget to allow so.

The anime deserves a fair score, from top down to bottom, this is good. 
We are just smart enough to know even a newcomer hit anime series cannot shine if blaringly pale 3DCG is used."

For those who are used to watching isekai, you can skip this anime, but if you are just starting to watch the genre, it is worth giving it a chance. The art is very well done, and for an anime, the 3D leaves something to be desired. There are times when it is not very fluid and the pony animation looks strange, looking like a windmill. Touka is the typical character who wants to destroy the character who wanted to screw him over. Heis an anti-hero, but three characters soften him up: his uncles and Seras. I believe that by the end of the work, he will either become a villain or simply carry out his revenge and disappear from the map with his romantic interest. There are times when the story seems to rush a bit, but the events occur in a satisfactory way. I haven't seen many isekai, but I really liked this one and I hope there is a second season with better direction and they don't use too much 3D in the monster fight scenes."

Just think of the amazing and messed upstories we could produce and enjoy as a culture.  Yeah, there would be so much trash and crap, but oh man... the highs, the potential for great stories. 
That being said, I love the story of Failure Frame, I’ll read the manga because I’m sure everyone will bitch enough about the ""bad CGI and poor animation"" for this to not get a continuation. And I do like this story... yes, I am simple minded fool and do not have the years of experience, nay, The Prestige that comes with being old. Watching anime that from bygone errors, “My anime has done it before or was of a higher class of this trash”.  No, I do not need to see your list of mandatory anime to enjoy what I am watching now.
Remember the only good opinion is the one you keep to yourself.  Yes, I know, my opinion doesn’t matter either."
57892,540746.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Basically, the plot is similar to Arifureta, but worse. The first few episodes didn't seem too bad to me, but as the story progresses, it just keeps getting worse. The story is about an isekai where the main protagonist is exiled from the hero's party and thrown into a dangerous dungeon to die, but he discovers he has an overpowered ability that allows him to defeat strong enemies. Everything in this story is highly predictable, as you would expect from a typical isekai anime. In an isekai, you usually expect a generic plot but hope for good side characters, interesting designs, exciting fights, or at least somefunny moments. Unfortunately, this anime has none of that.

I would only recommend this if you're really addicted to overpowered protagonists."
57892,538523.0,5.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"It's exactly like Arifureta, but without the harem, and very low budget. The animation hurts the eyes, the plot develops somewhat okay-ish but it doesn't tackle the vilain at all. Maybe this will be worth watching if the second season is able to save this anime's overall rating, but so far you are better off watching other isekais. Animation: 3/10 - the CGI hurts the eyes. Characters: 6/10 - an expressionless OP MC makes it hard to give this a better rating. Plot: 6/10 - in the beginning the story is really good, but then as the MC gets free in the world it gets boring really fast. Overall:5/10. It's not worth the watch unless the second season somehow saves the story and they invest a bit more on their animation."
54968,537632.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Who needs 100 girlfriends when you can have 1 girlfriend with 100 personalities? Giji Harem takes “get you someone that can do both” to the next level and is one of the most satisfying seasonal romances you’ll see. A nonstop heartwarming ride that’ll have you covering your face and gushing like an idiot. Eiji and Rin are one of the cutest couples around, and what makes them standout in a crowded field of romance shows lately is the romantic progression! Going from a kouhai-senpai relationship with the personality switching acting gimmick to a full blown relationship, dates, kissing etc all in the same season isalmost unheard of these days and makes this a must watch for any romance fan. 

Giji harem was an amazing time for me. The persona switching gimmick was something different and I like how it was a way for Rin to communicate her feelings with Eiji under the guise of practicing her acting skills. Episodes were idyllic bliss and went by in a flash. Every scene with the two leads together just felt like a cuteness overload and I would’ve been content with just seeing 12 episodes of them goofing off. But what made this such a memorable experience is that we see the two of them develop so much throughout. Usually gag series just kinda stay as gag series, but it’s clear the author had a plan in mind and wanted the couple to grow together which is beautiful. Rin slowly goes from only being able to express her emotions via the personality switching to saying how she feels on her own. Eiji gets the courage to tell Rin how he feels to her and not just her characters, and by the end of the series we see a couple that’s able to be themselves around each other. My only real complaint about it is that the off screened some of the big turning points in the story which seemed odd to me as a creative choice. With a little bit of common sense you can easily see the shift in the relationship and fit the pieces together, but I really think it would’ve been nice to show those moments to the audience!

I think this might be Hayamin’s magnum opus. She truly shines like never before in this show because of the number of personalities she portrays. We see a range that I didn’t know she had and she brings Rin to life. The chemistry that she and Eiji’s seiyuu have shines through and makes their relationship that much sweeter. Normally I talk about the animation and art, but this is a show that truly is elevated by amazing voice acting. It does of course look great too, Rin is genuinely a star girl and the amount of screenshots I have of her just looking cute is astonishing. 

If you’re a romance fan and just want to watch something that’s pure, no fanservice, no uncomfortable scenes, no spineless MC who can’t tell a girl how he feels, just two people that fall in love and get a satisfying conclusion this is the one it’s really as simple as that. It’s as advertised and I will certainly miss it. 

Giji Harem gets a very easy 10 personalities out of 10"
54968,537732.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"It really has been 3 years since my first review but I can't help myself from not actually reviewing my dream come true of an anime wrapped up and tied perfectly with a bow in 12 quick episodes. As one of Saori's biggest fans if not the biggest fan I can't stress enough how enjoyable Giji Harem was! So if you are looking for reasons to watch: 1) The biggest reason definitely has to be Saori Hayami and if you like listening to her voice from acting normally to taking several different character personalities and tropes with the cliches included and making them her own with asmuch color and originality to them that is bound to make you smile from ear to ear.

2) How heartwarming the relationship portrayed here really is, from the comedy Eiji is bringing to the table to Rin's sheer determination to give Eiji his own harem as he has pictured it to the best of her abilities.

- Of course no perfect anime exists and Giji Harem is no exception -
There's no need to hide the fact that while Nomad has done their absolute utmost to follow the manga to a tee and they have accomplished it with flying colors, while the art style with its pastel-like nature gives the anime a breath of fresh air and uniqueness in the endless romance galore we got nowadays, the animation on the other hand is a bit rough around the edges in a few camera pan-back cases. 

Overall rating - 10
So why the 10 when there's clearly downsides to the show as mentioned? Because by no means does that ruin the experience in any way. Not only do I see myself and any Saori fan rewatching Giji Harem multiple times over but it is a COMPLETE anime that, as much as it saddens me, does not warrant or need a 2nd season so it respects your time as the cherry on top!"
54968,538406.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"This anime is definitely different, the fact that the girl had 6 personas inside reminds me of the protagonist from Persona 3 with many personas. But seriously, that's definitely the main point of this anime and to be honest it's something you either like or dislike because that's definitely a reason why most people only have one personality because it's very chaotic at some point. But in my opinion, this chaotic interaction between these two protagonists really brings naturalness to how they develop their emotions. I would say it starts off pretty slow in terms of romance with the male lead being almost non-existent, but thecouple is certainly fun to watch as it breaks the mold of normal couples, leading to more playful moments between the two that are very natural and enjoyable to watch.

There aren't many other big highlights, but it's a very solid slice of life that if you can keep up with this crazy couple it will certainly put a smile on your face if you like romance, and it also doesn't have a very cliché development so it's worth checking out.

Also, this is my opinion, so I don't think it's going to help much... but I was inspired to write this."
54968,538365.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Welcome to the review of a much awaited adaptation manga adaptation. Maybe too ""awaited"". It honestly felt like a small studio saw that for some reason no one decided to adapt this semi-popular romance manga and decided to give it a go. The results are what you would expect. The story is pretty cute, with a very positive and feel-good vibe. Its not a story with a lot of hard-hitting and thought-provoking elements because, honestly, it doesn't need to be. It's what a weekly rom-com should be while trying to be as inoffensive as possible and it achieves of making the viewer watch the showwith a smile. The story is definitely the best part about the show (mainly because the source material already did a good job). Of course, because its a romance anime, it sometimes accepts some plot-holes in order to advance the story, especially at the ending (even though I thought the last episode was the best).

Now we are done with the good things because I want to move on to the very bad stuff, the animation and music. Honestly, the only positive I can find in the technical side of the show is Rin's voice actor being very good. Other than that the show fails miserably, making us wonder why they even bothered animating the panels. The animation is very bad, its very rigid and slow, shots linger for too long and its clear when you pay attention that the backgrounds had no thought put into them. The music is even worse, the opening is actually one of the worst songs I have ever heard and the ending song is very forgettable. The music during the show is also so bad its distracting from the scenes and sometimes the show just says ""fuck it"" and just doesn't do music for a scene at all. It feels like a lot more love could have gone in this show and its kinda sad to see such a nice manga receive such lackluster treatment.

That's why my final rating for this show is a 6.5/10. It can be enjoyable and fun but I just can't really recommend an anime that is so clearly worse than a manga that isn't even that impressive artistically."
54968,540369.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Most adorable Rom-Com I watched. Rin is just too cute. VA went on full throttle for sure. Since all of this is in description, it doesn't count as a spoiler. Girl is acting multiple personalities to create a pseudo-harem for the guy she admires. This is what show is about. Subjectively i gave it 10/10, objectively i would give it 8/10. I gave it 10/10 because show is very enjoyable and Both MCs are very adorable together, the way they act, the way they treat each other. Born out of friendship and goofing around, grown into romance. Very healthy, enjoyable and cute anime. VA generally isvery gentle with her voice and voices many gentle characters, but seeing her in all her various character personalities was truly amazing. That's the main reason i gave it 10/10. Being a VA is 1 thing, but adapting to multiple personalities at the same time is truly amazing. and MC herself Nanakura Rin is very cute and adorable."
54968,537696.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"If I had to use a word to summarize ""Giji Harem"" it would probably be wholesome. The romance in this anime is incredibly sweet, and I found myself constantly smiling at their interactions. I must admit that I did not have high expectations based on the name which seemed a bit cheesy, but I was pleasantly surprised by just how much I ended up liking this. I was however, very confused about the pacing in this show. What I mean by that, is that the show has issues in how to pace the plot. The story tends to jump around as the two main characters, NanakuraRin and Kitahama Eiji, develop their blossoming relationship. There isn’t a clear plotline that the show follows, and at times, it’s hard to tell how much time has passed between episodes or even between scenes in some cases which tends to get confusing and harms the watching experience. Towards the later stages of the show it starts to skip a LOT and the time jumps seemingly get bigger as the plot moves in such a quick pace. This leads to the anime feeling a bit rushed. I wasn’t a fan of the art style and animation either as it felt too simplistic. It’s hard to describe, but when compared to romance series from larger studios, the visuals just seem very basic and they lack a certain flair. 

With the negatives out of the way, I liked that the last episode truly feels like it wraps the story up and gives a satisfying conclusion, which is again after a rather large time jump where it also does not get specified just how much time was skipped. Nevertheless, the story is finished and without spoiling too much I feel like this project does not require further seasons as the story is complete. I really want to praise the Japanese voice actors of the two main characters as they did a fantastic job in giving life and depth to the characters which was really important. Both of them are very known names and have appeared in many popular Animes, so I suppose it was to be expected of them. 

This romance feels very different from the usual romance. The ""Harem"" aspect is honestly pretty creative and works most of the time. I ended up enjoying this a lot, especially cause of the dynamic the two main characters have. The way they interact and flirt is just so unique and adorable. It does have some issues and flaws but the positives outweigh it, leading to a very good romance anime. I think that avid romance fans such as myself will truly enjoy ""Giji Harem"", and I would recommend giving it a try. I think you won't regret it."
54968,538425.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"In an anime, there are some that start out good, but end up bad, and there are some that start out bad but end up good. Maybe this anime is good at the beginning but bad at the end, bad here means boring. Let me explain: This anime features our two MCs, a male MC and a female MC. Honestly, at first I thought this was a perfect match. For the comedy and plot twist, I think it's very good, even some scenes really made me laugh. But unfortunately it all didn't last long, one of the factors that made this anime boring was the comedy which became less andless funny!
For some comedies, it seems like just a repeat of the previous episode, for example Oh this is a spoiled brat, Oh this is a calm girl, Oh this is a Tsundere girl.
Yes, all of that seems like a repetition, what's different is perhaps the words, but the essence is still the same.
Especially towards the end, like in episode 11 which seemed to drag on even more, so the boredom increased even more!

Another shortcoming is in the art style, as we know that the female MC plays various character roles, but unfortunately the creators look ordinary, there is no improvement in the character to make it cuter, for example when he becomes a Tsundere Girl, but he still looks ordinary, There is no improvement that makes the audience like one of the characters, for example I like it when the MC turns into a Tsundere or something like that.

Overall this anime is good, but not for all the episodes, as I said before this anime gets bad at the end.
This anime is good, but it only works for a single watch, and no rewatches!"
54968,539607.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"This anime is a rather odd combination of really good and, well, not very good. I'm actually really conflicted about how I feel about it, because the good is really good, and the bad is pretty bad. I think the best summary I have of this anime is it's basically ""Don't toy with me miss Nagatoro"" if the main characters were actually likable. Okay, let me start out with the good. First, this anime is unique. It's as if someone took a look at all of the anime like ""Nagatoro"" where the girl is a tease, the main character is a spineless wimp, andtheir romance is inexplicable, and then just turned that entirely on its head.  The FMC is a shy, easily embarrassed girl who uses her formidable acting skills to hide how she really feels.  The MMC is a cocky guy who teases the girl just as much as he has over the top reactions.  This leads to a rather unique character interaction profile where the two MCs tease each other, make each other laugh, and basically just have fun getting to know each other.

I wish this wasn't so rare, but it really is.

In certain places important to the story, they also took great care with the animation, and it's stunning.

Also, without spoiling, the ending was actually satisfying, ending in a way I have yet to see any other rom-com end, and so much the sadder.  There's no holding out for a second season here, it's all wrapped up.  And that's really good.

And no fanservice or ecchi.

Also, the little sister is very cute.

Okay...  now the bad.

Essentially, this anime got boring.  After a while I was kind of figuratively looking at my watch wondering when it was going to wind down.  After episode six, it was about ninety percent making each other giggle, and the other ten percent giggling about making each other giggle.  This was something I liked, except they overdid it.  So the parts that were refreshing also got a little tiring.  It picked up again around episode 11 or 12, but the time between then just wasn't interesting.  Maybe there's a reason the way they did this is unique.

Also, the animation was very scattershot.  As I mentioned, sometimes they really took care with it.  Others, it was lazy, and it became clear that they were just repeating a few frames over and over again.  I guess budget constraints are a real thing.

Also, while the dynamics were not as over-exaggerated as in many rom-coms (girl says something flirty, guy goes ""WOOOOOAAAAHHHHHHH"" and steam comes out of his ears), there was quite a bit of that.  While it wasn't as bad as many anime, and uniquely, both characters did that as well, it got really annoying really fast.

So, I could have rated it a 5 or a 9.  I split the difference.

If you're looking or a unique rom-com that plays with and only marginally successfully subverts the typical anime rom-com tropes, you'll like this.  If you want a sweet story with a satisfying conclusion, you'll like this.  If you want a plot that actually moves forward at a consistent pace, or realistic character interactions that don't consist of over the top reactions to even the slightest flirty comment... probably not for you. I'm giving this ""mixed feelings"" because for all of its potential of being a decent subversion of the typical annoying rom-com tropes, it came this close but didn't quite pull it off."
54968,540446.0,9.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"This anime is different than most anime’s. It has some common troupes and the beginning half of the anime was mostly small snippets, meaning there wasn’t much story, just random slice of life moments. However, towards the end of the anime, there was GOOD tear jerking moments for me that really sold it. At first I thought it was another random events anime, but it had a lot of story! So I would stick until the ending for a surprise I didn’t even expect Some moments I thought was a little cringy but other moments made me had grin behind blankets. It was a wild ride.The reason I score it like this is because some would really love it while others won’t but I would definitely rewatch it! 

The voice actors for this was perfect. Changing in between personalities and I can definitely feel the emotions from both main characters!  

I wish they would show some “scenes” more and I got confused like what just happened sometimes. But all in all I would recommend to someone that watches romcom anime’s regularly, but probably not for someone is getting into it

Thanks for listening to my review :)"
54968,538218.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"I'll be honest, Giji Harem left me underwhelmed. As a romance anime enthusiast, I thought I'd found my next obsession. Instead, I got a simplistic, predictable storyline that failed to deliver emotional depth. The premise sounds cute: girl crushes on senpai, senpai falls in love, they confess, and get married. But trust me, it's not. The conversations between Eiji and Rin dominate 95% of the screen time, making it feel like an endless, sappy date. I nearly dropped it by episode 5, but my curiosity kept me going. The only redeeming quality is Rin's multiple personalities - tsundere, cute, cool, and devil. It's entertaining to see heradapt to Eiji's desires. But Eiji himself? Mediocre face, talentless except for drawing, and utterly dependent on Rin.

What bothers me is the lack of:

1. Character development: Eiji and Rin feel like cardboard cutouts.
2. Conflict: No real obstacles or challenges in their relationship.
3. Emotional connection: I didn't feel invested in their love story.

I've watched better romance anime with more nuanced storytelling and memorable characters. Giji Harem feels like a missed opportunity.

Pros:

1. Unique concept (Rin's multiple personalities)
2. No unnecessary fan service or ecchi content
3. Refreshing change from typical harem anime tropes

Cons:

1. Weak storyline
2. Underdeveloped characters
3. Lack of emotional depth

Recommendation: Only for die-hard romance fans seeking a lighthearted, easy watch.

Final Thoughts: Would I rewatch it? Probably not. Would I recommend it to friends? Only if they're desperate for a romance anime fix.

Watching romance anime like this always brings back nostalgic feelings, reminding me of those moments when emotions and hopes were woven into every scene. It feels like revisiting that time when my heart would flutter, following the romantic journeys of characters that felt so real—especially in those classic, vanilla romances that perfectly capture the sweet simplicity of love without the need for drama or complexities."

Sometimes, you just need a refresher from drama, childhood friends, and whatever the fuck other romance (at least shitty ones) animes are up to. Each episode keeps me smiling and just hoping for the best to this couple. Some people I've talked to think the story is predictable. But is that really a bad thing? Sometimes, you just don't need to think and overanalyze a romance anime (touch grass please) for hours. I love how Pseudo Harem keeps me entertained and no one loses in the ending. It's a perfect lighthearted animeeveryone needs once in a while.

Also, Saori Hayami's performance in this anime is fucking amazing. She really showed her insane range in 12 episodes. And it's great seeing Nobuhiko Okamoto playing a character that doesn't fucking yell every 5 seconds."
54968,538321.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"One of the most wholesome things you can watch or read! The anime did really well, having a really intimate song for an opening that I say is worth a listen to and understanding, and the voice actor did well with the multitude of voices to play Rin and her characters. Despite the title being, ""Pseudo Harem,"" the key aspect is, ""a story."" This was how the show began and how it ends, even being mentioned in the episode titles and their dialogues. I have to mention this because I've seen someone say that towards the ending, it diminishes what this show is about, which Ifeel it doesn't because it was a fitting conclusion to their story of a pseudo harem, this was just a chapter of their lives. In fact, the ending basically gave us the start of a new story.

If you've made it this far, whether you have seen the title or not, I really wish we can somehow contact the author because I would die for anything about these two. Show us their new story! I don't care if it's just 1 page or a promotional art, I really love how Rin is so dedicated to Eiji, it's so wholesome. Petition for the mangaka to get a twitter account please! Some mangakas with twitter would sometimes post soome stuff of their characters.
Maybe make a continuation like Takagi-san or Seki-kun! I would even pay to ask the author to consider, hust to get the idea across.

Unfortunately, the anime may have been overshadowed by Alya, so this may be a hidden gem. If you like Alya being Russian, you should like Rin voicing a psuedo harem."

Another think is that the anime only shows us the love life of the two and how they become a couple, there not many side characters and the few of them are not so important for the love life of this two. The Art Style is also very beautiful and the story is also funny, because the fact that it is a harem with only one girl and how she acts like there were moregirls.

I want to give a rating of 7 not so, this anime deserves a rating of 8 from me, because thelast episode made me feel mixed, happy, sad, confused, but behind the ordinary visuals there is a story that is not extraordinary but keeps me entertained, an ending that is okay for season 1, I like it, I am entertained and this anime is worth it for a distraction, that's all from me, maybe you can correct or add, I want to watch other anime ciao."
54968,538634.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"A romance that I didn't expect anything from, it upset me at the beginning, but in the end it made me feel like everything would be okay. Like anime, you have to start with the bad and leave the good for the end. The worst thing that the anime has to offer is to speed up all the typical events of romance in the first 3 chapters. We're talking about 2 years of school life in 3 chapters. Sometimes you couldn't even get a good taste of a date, because in the next scene they were already on to something else. The scenes are short, nomore than 5 minutes, so in one chapter you could have 5 to 8 scenes, with different situations that gave you little time to digest what was happening. The secondary characters don't help the anime either, they're NPCs. The drama club mates, who should be there to add a different flavor to the story, are simply extras that instead of contributing, end up being a bit annoying.

Of course, as I said, everything gets better towards the end. Once the romance is consolidated and the couple is formed, the story begins to slow down little by little. What at first was a rush of typical events, in the second half we finally got to know more about the personality of our protagonists. We were able to understand them and empathize with their current situation. As they approach the final chapter, the romance becomes more solid and we really get to buy the idea that they are made for each other. The final chapter is one designed to ease your heart, to make you have faith in humanity and if we exaggerate a little, it is so sweet it could give you diabetes. The little drama in the story is appreciated, because sometimes one simply seeks to enjoy a story without getting depressed in the attempt.

If you don't get sick to your stomach with all the content that they want to feed you in the first half, you will get to enjoy a sweet and delicious dessert in the second part. A dessert that will make you think that in the end the food wasn't so bad."

The romantic plot doesn't have much complexity or development, so if you're looking for deep romantic progression, I wouldn't recommend this anime. Each episode is incredibly soothing and relaxing—it's the good anime to watch after a long, tiring day. The story is unique but somewhat predictable. For me, this isn’t an issue because I enjoy this type of genre. The art style and character design aren't particularly original, but they fit perfectly for a school-themed anime. I did feel the lack of good supporting characters, as they all seemed fairly average to me. So, if you're looking for a light anime to relax withouthaving to think too much, I highly recommend this one"

Has proper closure too, which is not that common, so these 12 episodes end properly, no need to beg for an OVA or season 2. The story as an idea is quite good, it works too. The first half has a bit of pacing issues and a ton of source material skipped (this is true for the whole show, but it's way more noticable and annoying in the first half), but it's more interesting. The second half hasmuch better pacing but the romance part of the show is tuned down a bit.

The characters are just as oblivious as in other shoujo romcoms, but they're likeable and well written. Visuals are good, but I disliked the way the characters' face look like, but I guess that's personal preference.

It's not a deep show, but it's a pretty comforting, casual watch. If you're looking for some lightweight, innocent romance story that's sometimes funny it's up there for sure."

Everything was adapted properly, and the story itself was amazing as well. Highly recommended for people who just want a fluffy wholesome cute romcom. Honestly the GOAT. The story is very unique in that one girl has amazing acting ability and thus pretends to be a whole harem for the MC.

But surprisingly enough this turned out to be a wholesome anime which at least deserves 8 rating. Not only this is laidback anime with romance and comedy but it has other things as well. Like the Female MC gets a offer regarding something(not giving away spoilers) but she’s not ready for it. She was dreaming for it to happen but when it did she wasoverwhelmed. It has its moments. MC is living a life which we all dream to🌚 It will make you laugh and right after it will make you shy. It’s a slow burner.

55848,534223.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Suicide Squad Isekai is an inconsistent but enjoyable watch. As a massive DC comics fan I really enjoyed seeing characters from the universe I love so much brought to the medium I love so much. WIT weren’t always perfect during this show’s run, but when they cooked, they really cooked. At its peak the animation is stellar and the characters are great. The main weaknesses you’ll find here are the pacing and inconsistent production values. That aside, a really good watch that I will miss. Isekai Suicide Squad is basically your run of the mill isekai plot except with the Suicide Squad characters and theusual Amanda Waller “I’ll blow your head off if you disobey me gimmick” now for me, that’s more than enough to hook because I freaking love Harley Quinn and these characters. Ever since the 2016 suicide squad film I’ve been a fan of the team and I’ve been a Harley stan since BTAS. So just having those sort of diverse personalities, which is a total contrast to the usual anime characters you get in a fantasy, is more than good enough for me. The team helps out a kingdom in the midst of war and we see our DC group form some really cool friendships with people in the isekai world. Some cool fights, couple cool plot twists and your expected foul mouthed dialogue. It ain’t revolutionary but damn it’s fun as a comic fan. 

Now, that’s the good, but unfortunately this show did have some bad. For starters the pacing is pretty bad for like the first half of the show. It takes a really long time building up and a couple episodes felt like they could’ve been filler. Now in a show with only 10 episodes that’s obviously not good. The animation also went to abysmal levels around episode 4, reaching its worst point during the dragon fight scene in episode 5. It does seem like that was an outsourced episode and things got gradually better from that point onwards culminating in a solid close to the series and some great action in episode 9. But beware. The other issue I have with this is how claustrophobic the world felt. I mean the entirety of the show basically takes place in one country’s castle. We don’t do much exploring, adventuring or really getting that proper isekai experience other than the fantastical medieval setting. That was a bit of a bummer for me because I think they could’ve done more with the world. 

Character rise let’s be real, we know any show with Harley Quinn is going to be dominated by her and she’s definitely the protagonist of this one and gets the bulk of the focus. Her relationship with the princess as well as joker are big in this even though the latter isn’t in the story a lot physically he is omnipresent due to his influence over Harley and for once it’s pretty positive. Clayface and King Shark I thought were dope and then Deadshot, peacemaker and Flagg in that order in terms of story relevance. Could’ve been better but with only 10 eps you’re a little limited.

I think on the whole WIT did a solid job. It’s not the best show ever but it was very fun and I hope it leads to us getting more DC superhero content in anime form soon, especially with the popularity of My Adventures with Superman and DC turning to manga for characters like Superman and Joker.

55848,534269.0,3.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,The one good thing I can say about this show is the characters are animated well and are drawn beautifully. The CGI doesn't feel out of place like the bad ones we tend to notice. The good aspects of the show ends there. This show was unneeded for the franchise. The plot is all over the place and doesn't establish itself as knowing what it wants until the last few episodes (way too late into the game). It felt like I was watching a cash-grab. Isekai as a genre is already oversaturated; I was betting on this to be good based on the teambehind the serie. But what I got was something half baked
55848,535009.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"i'm glad this show exist, it's pure and honest dumb fun, this anime doesn't takes it self so serious, it knows what it is, and i'm kinda sad that at the end they teased a 2nd season, that probably won't happen, because outside of people mocking the idea and existence of this, i saw nobody talking about it, so i hope that at least it does well in japan for it to get another season, but if you are a die hard comic fan or fan of an specific member of the squad you probably won't enjoy this, because these interpretations are the most outthere that i've seen, i  personally loved most of them (except harley and joker, but mostly because i'm tired of how much dc push them in everything, i know they're they most popular characters, so that's inevitable, but still, this jokar potray ufffff this was the most hot topic joker i've eveer seen, been beated only by jared leto joker, but i'm still interested to see what would they do with him in an hipotetical 2nd season), i don't know who idea was to make clayface a fuckboy weeb, but man i'm glad he was, you don't have an idea of how much i enjoyed him, my only problem it's that i can't see this clayface as villain to batman, he seems to nice to be doin crimes,  but other than that i found him very entertaining, deadshot was pretty cool, i like how he well he worked with al the members of the squad, and how cool he was without trying to much (like will smith's deadshot that tryed way to much to act and being cool), peacemaker i'm not much familiar with this character outside the movie he was previously in, but i loved how unhinged and stoic he was most of the time, and of top of that he was voiced by takehito koyasu, who's always nice to hear, and king shark was cute i guess, i don't have to much to say about him, he worked really well with the rest of the cast, so i'm glad he's here, so if you watch this, don't expect too much, lower your expectations, don't expect an adaptation of the suicide squad members as you know them, because they're mostly not, and just i don't know turn off your brain, this is one of those animes you watch while eating and don't think too much of it, because the history it's just there to make these characters look cool, and man if they look cool, i was surprised by how nice this anime looks, wit did a nice job, it's not perfect, there are some cuts that looks off, but this anime looks mostly good, so give it a try"
55848,536124.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I finished this show being left with only 1 question, what the hell did people expect? My confusion when it comes to this show's reception was only matched by the time I stepped on a Lego, for it to just disappear and never be found... So bare with me for a sec. From episode 1 I was seeing a dangerously notable amount of complaints about the animation being bad which if you have ever held a pen in your hand you would realize how absurd that claim is. As if I hadn't already been convinced that the anime community didn't know what good animation is, this wasgoing to be the final nail on the coffin, but against all odds as the show went on... there was some level of truth to it. So the thing is, aside from episode 5 that had a decent amount of let's just say, not so great cuts, every episode of the show looks great in a vacuum, but when you look at them together....

There is a pretty serious lack of consistency. the show changes visuals, the characters change models (except Harley cause she hot), the way the fights are drawn, the way the movement is handled, everything is constantly changing. and the thing is none of it is bad, and if like me you're on the lenient side with visual consistency as long as it looks good, it won't bother you that much.... but it makes the show's visual as a whole feel messy.

Extremely polished messy, but messy. It's like a dish 20 chefs made using top class ingredients while not communicating and passing the dish together hoping it works out by the end. and It probably won't taste horrible, but you clearly taste the.... wait, what was I talking about?

oh yeah, the show.

Everything else is exactly what you expect.

It's a suicide squad anime held back by being forced to follow a generic isekai outline. The soundtrack is amazing and the op and ed are also both really good. Anime Harely Quinn is hot and entertaining in the best way possible.... the rest of the cast are fine too I guess.

The best (and worst) part of the whole thing is, the way it has been set up, a s2 would top this one in every way possible. As you see in the final episode, the conflict they set up for the sequal is infinitely more interesting than the generic shlob that was the villain of s1. 

and the princess actually was set to become really interesting going forward. Idk about you, but I smelled a bit of a yuri in the air. could just be my imagination though.

Anyway, go in expecting it to be what it is, and you won't be disappointed. 

If you're a fan of suicide squad, firstly, I'm sorry for the sheer amount shit you have went through. but also this is actually in the great zone as far as none comic suicide squad media goes. 

If you're an isekai trash enjoyer, I see no reason for why you wouldn't enjoy this. I guess it's not as much of a power fantasy, but it has all the other elements that make the genre what it is. to me that's a negative, but that's besides the point.

If you want a great story, or top tier writing, or an emotionally rich experience in a fantasy world, go watch frieren or made in abyss or something. This is popcorn entertainment at it's (almost) finest. And there is a severe lack of rule34 from it. Like let's not lie to ourselves, 90% of us watched this for anime Harely."
55848,534238.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"The plot doesn't make sense, but that's also what makes it so good. In short, I feel like they did a pretty good job in making a fun show to watch without really fussing on having to think deeply about its content. The only experience I had previously with Suicide Squad was the 2021 movie, which got me to know a couple of characters here (some are from other DC works) but even then they all felt varied and fresh. The fights were generally good and well animated (barring episode 1 which was pretty bad, and barring the random CGI monsters). OST was also on point, and the EDsong was really good (the original reason I came to watch this show).

If you want to turn off your brain and have fun, I feel like this show does just that."
55848,534303.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Superheroes in an isekai is a good idea. Supervillains in an isekai is an even better idea, and Tappei's Suicide Squad Isekai is a decent execution of that concept. The cast is charming, and while the show spend too much runtime on fighting to really develop its characters, it helps that they're known IPs and anyone who's seen the James Gunn movie, for example, will appreciate the show not wasting their time. To me who's not really a fan of American superheroes, this rendition of the suicide squad is the definitive version for me. Harley Quinn especially feels like she was always meant to bean anime girl.
Story-wise, I felt like it dragged a bit in the middle, but it was overall fine. The first few episodes were a great start, acknowledging the novelty of the concept and delivering a lot of hype moments, and the twist at the end was interesting. However it became apparent that it wasn't really as creative as it could be, like they wrote the most natural story that came to mind from the ""Suicide Squad Isekai"" concept without really seeing where it could go. Overall a perfectly good DC work and battle anime, but nothing too groundbreaking."
55848,535448.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Overall I don't think this anime is as bad as the score it has, but I can't say it's good or recommend it to you either. It all comes down to personal taste! The first drawback for me is that the beginning of the story is too complicated, for some viewers it will definitely feel uncomfortable and difficult to digest the contents of this anime story, between people who are doing research to create Isekai holes, and people who are committing theft. At this point I almost stopped continuing, but I was trying to enjoy this anime so I kept watching. The second flaw is in the comedy part,is this anime actually going to focus on comedy or not? Wondering about this! If this anime is going to be combined with comedy, at least make the comedy funny and not weird to watch! 
Often when there is a scene that I think shouldn't have comedy, suddenly a joke slips in which I think just ruins the atmosphere. Not only jokes, but the soundtrack is the same, suddenly changing into a soundtrack that sounds comedic, or relaxed or whatever to describe a situation that seems comedic.
For almost the entire episode, I didn't laugh or feel entertained at all with this overly contrived and unfunny comedy!

The third flaw is clearly in the art style, for some characters it seems like they were just made carelessly, especially their boss who has big lips and curly hair. Some of them seem to use an old-school art style and some of them use a modern art style, like the princess who is drawn quite nicely.

There's actually quite a lot I want to say, but that's enough for the gist of my review, Once again I can't say whether I recommend or not this anime, Because whether it's good or bad depends on you who watch it!
But one thing I want to say, the score describes the content of the anime but is not to be used as a benchmark, because there are quite a few anime with high scores that turn out to be bad and vice versa."
55848,534296.0,6.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"I want to like this series more than I do. As pure turn your brain off fun, it's not a bad time by any means. The sakuga goes hard when they go all out, the characters are varied and have the kind of zany personalities you would expect for something like this, and the setting lends itself to some ridiculousness. The trouble is two-fold. One, and the lighter of my complaints, I just don't think it does much to justify the setting beyond ""wouldn't this be cool!?"" Maybe that's kind of the point, that this fantasy world is a playground where our characters can havewild adventures, but they keep hinting at deeper dynamics with its monsters, kingdoms and magic that just never manifest. Worse yet, at least from where I'm sitting, they don't use that setting to the fullest. You would think that bringing these characters into a magical world would mean we'd get to see all kinds of crazy interplay between magic and their various powers and skillsets, but there's surprisingly little of it until very near the end. It's a wasted opportunity to make this as crazy as possible, though admittedly when its at its craziest, there's not a lot you can make out behind all the magic circles and colorful attacks.

Two, this series is based on existing IP. The Suicide Squad has canon behind it, and while I don't know a lot of it and don't expect this series to mirror everything (I personally don't mind that the relationship between Harley and The Joker is significantly lighter and more loving on his side - the abusive relationship has been done to death), I think it should get some of the major beats right. Haven't given my thoughts on this one up til now, but generally speaking, I expect three things from my Suicide Squad content: characters should die, their allegiances should always be in question, and they should wreck some shit. On all three fronts, I'd say this work fell short. It never felt like any of the main characters were in any substantial danger, though I'll hand it to the show that they're not exactly kind to the villains who they defeat. The characters just align with the main kingdom and there's rarely an indication that they're even considering working their own angles beyond doing what they have to in order to stay alive. And while they do cause a good deal of damage, it's usually to the enemy. There's generally very little sense that our main characters are or were villains. 

I think hitting these marks were the low-hanging fruit to make this anime work, and while it hits some of them from time-to-time, but misses more often. So while this was a decent enough popcorn watch, it's almost all empty calories that surprisingly doesn't go as hard as it could while failing to capitalize on the best parts of the IP."
55848,538505.0,5.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"As someone who really enjoyed the original Suicide Squad movie, I was really excited for this anime, though I had some reservations about the decision to make it an isekai Anime. And that worry turned out to be justified. The whole thing ended up being painfully average, with a story that felt forced and eventually spiraled into an incoherent mess by the end. I feel like there was so much potential here but it was all wasted. The opening is an uninspiring mashup of music, characters from the fantasy world have shallow backstories and are painfully stereotypical, the world-building is practically nonexistent, and the plot isdull, forced, and confusing. I feel like the biggest problem in all of this is that they opted to make the story into an isekai. The anime market is so over saturated with isekais these days which makes it so hard to stand out in the genre. And the fantasy world in "" Isekai Suicide Squad "" is quite frankly even below average, which causes the entire project to suffer. There's plot twists which are there to keep the story interesting but you can mostly smell them miles away. The animation can get choppy and goofy at times which just further adds to the negatives, though admittedly some fights in the later episodes were animated well and ended up being enjoyable. 

When it comes to the positives, I always try to be fair to shows and give it the benefit of the doubt. The show did a good job in advertising itself and I had seen a lot of posts on social media and trailers long before it even started airing. And let's be honest here, capitalizing on the trend of western franchises getting anime adaptations was a clever strategy. ""Suicide Squad"" is a name many people are familar with, which makes it easy to get people interested in your anime. The DC villains were drawn really well and especially Harley Quinn looked phenomenal. In fact, Harley Quinn was one of the few highlights of this adaptation. Her character design, voice acting, and overall portrayal all came together so well. 

In the end, this turned out to be a huge disappointment, though my high expectations likely played a big part in how let down I felt.  There's just too many issues that prevent you from truly enjoying ""Isekai Suicide Squad"" and I honestly also cannot recommend this to anyone curious whether they should watch it or not. It was average, though you could also make a case for it being even worse  and I would fully agree. It's sad, but this one truly missed the mark."
55848,534358.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"TLDR If you're looking for a very well animated action packed show with the stupidest story imaginable, this is right there for you, and that's exatly what I expected from it. ------------------------------------------------------------- This show's plot makes absolutely no sense, it's even very stupid at times, and the ending is really dumb, but what else are you expecting from an anime about the suicide squad being thrown into another world? A world that is more generic than vanilla ice cream at that. I came into this expecting dumb fun and what I got was exactly what I expected, this is an amazingly animated, action packed adventure with the dumbest plotimaginable, but that still beats 90% of Isekai coming out.

55848,534229.0,3.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"To think that one of the most prominent anime studios would think it's a great idea to implement Western-made characters and be put into an Asian trope-y concept though the isekai stories all set in European-named empires or kingdoms...well it's a one-off benefit show in terms of ""turn off your brain to enjoy the show"" method if you ask me. Isekai Suicide Squad may not be enjoyable if you expect the storytelling to be any different in a Japanese-made premise. In fact, it's got to be one of the dumbest decisions Warner Bros or specifically the production executives back in Japan to be made in animeform. I can see that this kind of series is recommended to DC diehard fans, particularly if they like the Suicide Squad comic books very much. Non-DC characters tend to be written with predictable stereotypes seen in isekai tropes.

As for the twists, it's nothing groundbreaking as long as you know that the most maniac character is meant to be crazily(?) portrayed that way. I'm just glad it's over, but I definitely don't want to see another season renewal. And hopefully me saying this will not be jinxed seeing how DVD sales still matter back in Japan. At least I can forgive WIT studio for animating their other current series that emphasizes the concept of absurdity in a good way unlike this Warner Bros' ""wasted resources on unimaginative concepts"" series."

The character design is excellent and probably the best part of the show. It is also probably a better Suicide Squad adaptation than we got in either movie or the super-hyped-up video game. Clayface, who seems to be the only character who really understands what it means to be isekai'd, which can be pretty funny. Also, this depiction of Clayface is better because he retains his identity of Basil Karlo, a famous Hollywood actor, and is not just a monster. Problems with this seriesare that it has a pretty shallow plot, and there is never any real peril, but it is still a fun watch. I would watch a season 2."

However, if you love Isekai-anime and/or love suicide squad, you will likely enjoy this! Also a certain someone has some mad dance moves in the ending ;) Content-wise it's a general save the other world type thing, but with a suicide squad twist. Since it's an isekai world, not DC-world, it allows some interesting abilities. Style-wise it's kind of nice but seems to be kind of low-tier in a lot of ways, while also being very pleasing to me. I love the fun and incoherent teamwork that just manages to work. The squad is somuch fun to watch and ~every-other episode gets a Joker memory which is both fun to watch and fun to have Harley bring up.

The villains (Director lady (in my eyes) and obvious person who's obvious) disgust me and hate seeing or hearing them. If you don't like it after the first episode, you probably won't like it at all."
55848,535088.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Suicide Squad Isekai is a roller coaster of feelings. Its good in some parts and sadly doesn't do well for others. But in the end, it was focused on fun and that's something I think people should look towards about it. Animation is great, but sometimes takes a little nose dive before picking back up again. The soundtrack is nice, and the characters are enjoyable to watch when they have dumb discourse. Peacemaker was my favorite. If you want some stupid fun, then this is your show. If you strive for better, there's a lot more out there for you and you should pounce atthe opportunity to find those. 

For my first and probably only Isekai, this was cool :)"
55848,535966.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"This anime despite all it's flaws, ended up being a really fun watch. That being said, I can't look over said flaws. Let's starts with the inconsistent animation an art style, some of these characters look like they're from completely different shows. If you put Harley Quinn and Deadshot or Clayface side by side, it looks like they came from alternate universes. Now the animation, I get it was most likely budget cuts, but the fight scenes in the beginning and middle portion looked like they were either missing frames or just slow in general. Thankfully, when they start fighting with other DC villains, thefight scenes increase tenfold and have way more of that Studio WIT charm we all expected.

Now the characters, other than Harley Quinn, I couldn't really get invested in anyone else apart of the squad. Clayface is an actor and references media and tropes, that's about all they do with him. Peacemaker is straight-faced and stoic, but can get scary. Deadshot is.. I can't really explain him, he seems like the straight man of the group I guess. and King Shark is..well, a shark that is always hungry. Along with the main group, there is also other DC villains thrown into this isekai world that are also part of the suicide squad comics such as Enchantress and Katana. They're fine, I guess. They don't have any major role other than being an obstacle later on.

Now let's get into the big reason why this show isn't as good as people anticipated, the actual isekai part. It. is. boring. As the suicide squad find a battle between human soldiers and orcs, they decide to intervene and kill all the orcs. However, since they can't communicate with them, the soldiers capture them and throw them in prison. They meet the queen and her daughter, they participate in some fights for the kingdom, and then they get thrown in jail again. rinse and repeat until the last few episodes of the series. The people from the isekai world are just so. freaking. boring. they don't like the otherworlders, except for the daughter of the queen. That's about it.

the pros like I mentioned are definitely the last 4 episodes, they go all out with the animation and fanservice for DC fans. The music is a plus too, the ending is by Vtuber Mori Calliope and it's a super fun song, the opening is pretty unique too, doing a more Baccano approach where it's just an instrumental, except instead of jazz, it's music you'd hear from a superhero action scene.

Is this show worth watching? I'd say so, not for the plot, but for the action. My expectations were let down a bit, this was not nearly as good as I was hoping, but it's a fun watch. it's only 10 episode long too, so you can probably finish it in a day if you had the time."
55848,534691.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Isekai Suicide Squad is an anime that had a very big potential but didn’t use it. From the start we have already characters that a lot of people love and you don’t need to spent time to write new once’s so you can put all of your effort to the story. But they didn’t. The story feels to rushed and not complete even if we gonna get the second season is still feels empty. We did have a good start about sending supervillains to another world for a mission even tho I was not always happy with what’s going on it was decent and a lotof people can enjoy it. We meet characters from another world, the squad get into problems and we learn new things about this new world ,after this I did feel like the middle we did have unnecessary episode for an anime that already gonna be short we only have 10 ep which is very short for spending whole ep for nothing. Towards the end the story start to get to a point and the fights were great I did enjoy them but here the biggest problem is start to show itself. Rushed and not complete story. Anime just started to throw everything in the last 3 ep without explaining why,who,were etc. The things that were plot twist was just moments that was not explained to usat all we didn’t expect them because we did have zero idea about them. For me this type of plot twist just lazy and uninteresting the villians was boring and I just didn’t care about them. To finish my take on story it did had a potential but that’s all.

The best part of this anime was main characters the Squad was great they were funny and interesting. Even tho they already existing characters still thanks for not ruining them. They are bot the best versions of themselves in DC universe but a good once’s King Shark was just perfect zero flaws best character.

The animation had lacked in some ep but it did have very good moments to so I was happy with it in the end.

If you wanna enjoy this anime you should see it as an medicore isekai with very great characters from the start. If you can ignore some stupid moments that sometimes writers just not explaining things to us and focus on fight I think people who likes isekai gonna enjoy it. Good fights and good main cast if you wants this yea its definitely for you."
55848,534562.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"The original concept had a lot of potential, especially with the collaboration between East and West, and if any DC group could embrace the isekai genre, it would be the Suicide Squad. With the scenario written by the Re:Zero author and animation by Studio Wit, it seemed like nothing could go wrong. However, the show plays it too safe with these concepts, resulting in a very mediocre outcome. I suspect this project was greenlit to promote a video game that also flopped, making it seem like this squad is cursed. There’s no blood, gore, or the usual anti-hero antics you’d expect; instead, the show feels morelike Suicide Squad 2016 than the James Gunn reboot. Most of the squad members act like teenage delinquents rather than actual villains, although the changes to Clayface's personality are interesting, and Jun Fukuyama's voice acting really enhances the character. But beyond that, the show doesn’t offer much.

The world-building feels barebones, with kingdom that seems just big enough for the squad to come in and save the day, rather than being part of a fully realized world. The conflict also feels forced, as it’s clear that most characters on both sides don't really want to fight, let alone kill each other. The Joker in this anime comes off as edgy, losing the charm that made him the Clown Prince of Crime, though that’s just my opinion. The animation isn’t great either; it’s obvious that the production team prioritized certain episodes and scenes over others, making some episodes, especially in the first half, hard to watch.

Amanda Waller's actions don’t make much sense either; she’s portrayed as a mastermind controlling everything, but when you think about it, her actions have little impact and seem more like plot devices. Overall, while the show is easy enough to watch and hints at a second season, I wouldn't be surprised if public disappointment shuts it down for playing it too safe with the material."
55848,534555.0,4.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"What do you get, when you base an anime on a messy live action movie, use its characters, rewrite them to fit tropes, and throw them into a generic isekai setting? The answer: A mess, that's called Isekai Suicide Squad. In short the plot is at the beginning: Force bad guys with bomb collars to help a kingdom in distress to secure resources. Later on there are some twist and turns, that don't make sense. Some characters get random power ups some don't, for whatever reason some have magical affinity some don't. The writing is not the only thing that is inconsistent, the animation also doesits part: Sometimes it's a pure sakugafest (like episode 7) and other times it's a mess.

As a guy, who liked the animated batman series and the animated suicide squad movies, I can't recommend this anime for fans in that regard. The characters are a complete joke: Amanda Waller, who is a very calculating threat, is here an idiot in regards who she gave a bomb collar. Deadshot is a joke, Peacemaker is just there, Killer Croc is so unremarkable my mate and I thought he would be just a random boss lizardman. Some of the antagonist characters sort of fulfill their role as villain of the day decently. The main antagonist on the other hand, hoo boy, is completely retarded, as she could've won before the anime even started. The kingdom characters are also nothing special: The most prominent of them like the princess is just an insecure nice girl and the hero, is a walking incompetent weak ass punching bag. The only characters I kind of liked, where King Shark, Clayface and Harley. King Shark is kind of an adorably dangerously dummy. Clayface is a flamboyant pop-culture nerd, which kindof works. Last but not least the star of the entire project, Harley Quinn, is overall a wacky nutjob, but a bit more pg and moral (still I don't like the portrayal of her relationship with Joker here). Speaking of Joker, I absolute despise him, he should not be a ""sexy"" romanceable/romantic nutjob!

All said and done, if you want a ""turn your brain off""-action show with a couple of wacky characters this show can be for you. Otherwise, if you want something more, don't watch it. 4+/10"

It was fun and quirky seeing how the suicide squad reacted to this new situation they found themselves in. It felt rather fresh, and novel compared to the many many regular old isekai. But the second half didn't really hit as hard. It wasn't bad, it was just mediocre or okay. I'd say it is worth starting, but finishing it is up to you. Harley pretty much carried the show. Joker was absent for all of it except a few scenes. The other suicide squad members felt more like supporting characters toHarley. Other than the mud-man and the shark man who had some fair presence and running gags, the rest were somewhat forgettable in terms of presence when placed next to Harley. The isekai world while quite visually interesting and not like a normal game starter town, there was minimal world building/lore and character design/depth.

However, it is the first time it combined the popular isekai genre with these assholes, pardon the language, from the Suicide Squad. So, it has your Japanese occidentalist fantasy setting, with elves, beatmen, dragons, and a whole lot of magic. It even has a loli death god for a final boss. The American contribution is the ultraviolence this particular set of characters have a penchant for. This version of the Squad even have their own magical girl transformation scene. The animation issuperb, about as well as can be expected from the Studio Wit. The producers must pull out the stops because this is a collaboration that can’t fail., 

However, the story is all over the place. There are several story points that remain unresolved, and it felt like the plot was just going around in circles. It is not as obvious when you are watching an episode weekly, but when you are binge watching, it will feel repetitive at times. 

This is a good show to watch with your brain off and just enjoy the quality animation poured into it.  If you are a DC comics fan who enjoys a bit of guilty pleasure isekai stories, this is for you. If you want to watch the hypnotic Amanda Waller dance number at the end credits, give in and enjoy it."
54724,538751.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Abstract art pieces, advanced visual storytelling, inspired direction and enormous creative energy wasn't what I expected going into Elusive Samurai, but here we are. The sheer quality of artistry put on screen here is even more puzzling when taking into account how simple this story is. The whole plot of the anime works only because it was skillfully elevated with great care and passion. First it is important to note that between those amazing highlights there is a whole bunch of normal anime and this normal anime looks great as well. Art Style is of course enjoyed depending on taste, but you can be certain thatthis isn't a generic looking random show, but bright colorful and energetic one. Even the character designs while fitting with the historic period, are often bonkers and enjoyable. There was a lot of effort put into animation from more mundane/comidic moments to epic fights. Those fights are helped by great choreography full of fluid movement and direction. The biggest strength of the Elusive Samurai shows in the fact that where others would have stopped at having great fights Elusive Samurai decides to show in a creative way more about characters. Sometimes a great sense of hearing will be represented by a gorgeous sequence, characters backstory will have a different style representing his feelings, emotions as a whole might be shown visually, a display of overwhelming power will become an otherworldy spiritual experience. With great direction and good focus a sense of disorientation in character will be skillfully portrayed. As I said the whole show isn't like that, but a lot is which is great to witness and used in a way that makes this competent, but simple story much more engaging. Quickly talking about sound, voice acting is very good but ost, while hitting during the highlights, was pretty unnoticeable.

I talk a lot about simplicity because it is true. Motivations are flat and many of the characters feel one note, but that doesn't mean everyone is like this. The whole plot is focused on the asymmetrical conflict of protagonist vs antagonist. Tokiyuki (good guy) has very engaging chellange of turning from a carefree, kind child into a responsible, charismatic leader while Takauji (bad guy) is a great execution of a simple, evil antagonist. His presence, power and attitude make him great to watch and the violence he is capable of give him a scary aura. Lesser antagonists are also mostly fun. Often very over the top, but in one example even given a small arc making me excited for the future of the rest of them. So yes story isn't anything special, but it's competent enough to be made special by the artistry surrounding it.

Now time for the bigger problem. This show is a comedy that tries its hand at mixing itself with tragedy and serious violence. Again comedy is subjective (I enjoyed it), but sometimes the jump from funnies to drama felt too jarring, it felt like a less skilled Gintama. Now it wasn't the worst attempt at doing something like that I saw, sometimes they do it well, but for someone unaccustomed to this approach bad mixing of tones can be a deal breaker. Either way be ready for a wacky show that tries to be serious from time to time.

To summarize I love abstract art enough to almost disregard all of the flaws in here, maybe despite them you will love it too."
54724,538777.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"I'll keep it short. This is an anime where perverts are the focal point of every conflict, hear me out. Coming from the same author who made Assassination Classroom, you'd be surprised to see how much gore this anime lets out, it's such a drastic change in tone and stakes, yet it does it in such a playful way, the only way to describe The Elusive Samurai is psychotic perverts fighting each other for their own 'fetishes'. The story starts off like an average coming-of-age plot about a young samurai, but like the title implies, the guy sucks at fighting and he also happens to be ashota. If you're familiar with the name 'Nagisa Shiota', this is the author doing the same thing with his protagonist again. From there on, you're introduced to the series' first perverts, Yorishige Suwa, who exhibits every behavior of a stranger trying to groom children, but that's okay since he also has a child and has divine energy emitting behind him, so he has to be a good guy right? This is where you realize that every character introduced here will be a bunch of weirdos from there on. Later on, you get the MC, voiced by an actress, enacting lines of a flushed child who just discovered his fetish of confronting death and 'elusively' runs from it (pun intended). It's an anime about relishing on the desire to live out your twisted fantasies in the sight of the battlefield.

Animation-wise, the anime for the most time looks good since it has CloverWorks name in it but you can tell it has some moments where it feels off. By the time they shifted to 3D animation, it becomes a battle of tolerance. But if you can keep up, it's not that bad. The anime also includes the time to paint antagonists the party has to encounter in the most psychopathic, dubious, and unholy of all expressions to ever exist. You have multiple characters that are recognised by their cartoonish-like characteristics, for instance, enlarged ears that makes a man look like a monkey. A character that looks like your savior-incarnate only to be a vile killer. A man whose eyes are about to pop out anytime and a thief who can literally shape-shifting his face into anyone they want to and make their same behavior. 

Speaking of characters, you just entered the lottery, ladies and gentlemen. In this environment of redundant perverts, there are in fact normal characters in this anime and it shows on the face of people who reside with the main character or central antagonist of the anime. Unless for a few exceptions, the story doesn't completely forget how a normal person acts. You're just shoved into the perspective of an abandoned noble meeting an endless amount of perverts that you might worry if the abyss stares back at you. You're never going to find a cast this twisted other than degenerate hentais with dubious roles or fanservice propaganda.

I'm not going to say that the anime is flawless by any means. The pacing for something that is meant to be chaotic and bamboozling ends up feeling slow and predictable. For something that wants to make a mature but playful tone, it ends up getting stale quickly once you know exactly what the characters' antics do. There's rarely any development, since most of that sweet 24 minutes per episode is focused on introducing bigger bad guys in a contest of becoming the incarnate of the Seven Deadly Sins, but only in Japan. And whenever there is one moment of character development, it's only given to Tokiyuki for very little development. The characters might have good design and a reason to exist, but without any reasonable development to grow alongside Tokiyuki, it makes them look like your cast of Naruto's chunin students who were set up to be rivals with different set of skills. Their supporting characters are made to be introduced, act like friends and rarely got feedback for their own growth as well.

It's sufficient in multiple aspects, like a jack of all trades, but likewise it also means the anime doesn't excel in any of them. You'll leave thinking of a decent experience, but you'll find yourself too bamboozled to make words out of the fetishes you were exposed to in this anime.

Thank you for reading."

Art style was such a feast to see - so experimental, beautiful fights scenes, so bloody, and such unique art style - tongue -in-cheek and gruesome and beautiful!!! Animators really had fun with it. On the plot front, the emphasis on turning failures into strengths or being strategic with your strengths is such an exciting concept for shonen. And so much mentorship!!!! My heart is so warm but also the brain is buzzing - I wanna channel Fubuki lol. Also great insight on samurai pride of that era and the birth of subversive technique and ninjas. Notto mention love the ongoing bit that Yorushige can see so far into the future he knows what’s up in the 21st century lol. We really ate well with this one - can’t wait for season 2."
54724,539295.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Finding unique and original ideas in anime these days is very difficult, so one could see that with a description like “In the year 1333, the Kamakura shogunate” that alone is very intriguing. The cover art shows a cute character leaping through the air, flames.. looks very flashy- ah a Samurai anime- I decided to take a look to see what it was. And the very first episode left me speechless. Not anything else I could say but totally frozen, and speechless. The characters are all very beautiful, and the main one (on the cover) called Tokiyuki and he’s totally adorable and runs around playinghide and seek with all the minders at the palace, jumping across rooftops- aw this show looks playful and cute is it a slice of life or something?… his brother joins in and now they’re kicking a ball around- and then flash to the next scene and it’s some guy’s HEAD. Next thing I remember, heads were rolling all over the place and blood was spewing in every direction. Like FOUNTAINS of blood. And my jaw just dropped open.

(After someone gave me some smelling salts) I came back to level- but Jumping James Batman! This anime is BONKERS!

It’s hard for me to explain to you. … you have these cute characters like Tokiyuki, Shizuku the princess, ………..so you have to imagine that, and then you have these warriors who seem kind of clownish, like maybe quite insane? And they slash hundreds of people to death- including women and children- and in the middle of the bloodbath THERE ARE FUNNY FACES. Several of the characters have this comedic disposition, and funny faces. So, this is a Battle Shonen. But it seems even more unhinged than a typical battle shonen. 

I understand Japan is a vastly different culture than here in the west; but I’ve seen enough of Japanese culture (not just in anime) and always sort of known- or maybe it’s something we’re all told- the Japanese sense of humor (among other things) is different than ours. Well watching Elusive Samurai reminded me of that, in the most extreme way possible. It was like being slapped in the face with reminders- that what they find amusing is…. uhh different. 

My biggest problem with this show was I couldn’t understand who it was made for? 
Like the cover art makes it look like a fun shonen anime for middle schoolers. But the level of violence- some of it surprisingly disturbing- just doesn’t seem like it’s for kids. If it really is meant as a kids show then geezus I don’t know what to say. It’s not serious enough for adults- that’s for sure- and the bonkers ED is pretty clearly aimed at young people. The odd mismatch with who the audience is supposed to be was really baffling. 

There doesn’t seem to be a lesson, or a morality tale being woven by this story either- like so many Samurai anime are famous for. It seems like a fun Catch-Me-If-you-can shonen with a cast of misfits who elude the goofballs of the Shogunate to fight another day; with no higher purpose than to just entertain (and remind you that the samurai were killers and that Japan’s past was VERY bloody) but here’s a funny face to make you laugh!! Isn't this FUNNY?!? Hahahaha!! SLASH
 It’s wild and totally ridiculous, but after 10 of the episodes I really stopped caring about the story and just watched with my brain off. My brain was SO disengaged that I really didn’t care much what was happening anymore… and the ending song actually started to sound interesting. 

I can’t really recommend this show based on if you like Samurai anime, or if you have any expectations about story. But if you just want to see pretty characters jump and flip in the air with their beautiful clothing flowing in the wind as they beat up goofy bad guys- then this will dazzle your eyeballs. It might possibly make you laugh kind of out of disbelief. You will definitely get dumber watching this, that’s for sure."

54724,539007.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"TL,DR This show might be a masterpiece in the making. The sheer quality of its production is worth a watch, WATCH IT. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This show made me realize I have been underestimating Cloverworks as a studio. Barring some really wonky horseback CGI shots, this is as close to a perfect production: the animation is consistently spectacular throughout, the art direction is absolutely beautiful, giving us some of the best most colorful visuals I've seen, the sound design is on point, the direction and storyboarding are endlessly creative, the way this show portrays horrific acts with its colorful artstyle makes those acts so much more terrifying. Episode 6 hadme jaw dropped the entire time and it should be used as an example to anime in the future.

This show deserves a watch just for the quality of its production alone. But that doesn't mean the story and characters are bad, far from it. If I had to critic anything about it, is some of the self-referential comedy isn't my favourite. But besides that this show is funny, charismatic, thematically interesting and dark in the right places. 

I hope the show continues because it has the possibility of being a true masterpiece. I will give it a 9 for now because we've only scratched the surface of what its capable of, but my hopes are really high"
54724,539264.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Elusive Samurai is a show where is exceptionally shrugged upon and under the damn rug. I barely see anyone talking about it. Easily top 5 of this season of anime (although not many good anime were here this season but I digress). Wonderful animation, good characters, decent story, and humor that actually caught me off guard. The one thing that was apparent is it’s obvious the animation department is struggling a bit. Elusive Samurai is amazing and has multiple episodes where it rivals Studio Ghibli especially with it’s soft colored and painted art, but you can see when CGI is used, and I think some partsof the anime didn’t cook enough. It isn’t much of an issue though since 80% of the anime is CHEFS KISS. But episode 4 and episode 12 were easily the worst in the animation department, almost fully utilizing still frames and janky CGI. But, I cannot talk ill of the rest.

The characters are good, but there are some that are just ‘there’ or ‘aight’ y’know, it’s a historical Shonen so expect some IRL names portrayed into characters like Dazai in BSD. Symbolisms in the anime were portrayed very well with what would be going on in 1333. The art is versatile too, a lot of sakuga, some stop motion, real life footage, cutout animation, and ofc the CGI. It’s like fucking Gumball.

Suwa is easily the best character~ (totally not biased because of Gojo VA)

They also have a lot of ugly ass characters as villains that gross me out. So thank you Elusive Samurai, I did not need to see protruding eyeballs and ears with teeth.
I wish some characters had development or some relevance, I do like some like Genba, Tokiyuki, and Suwa but everyone else is meh or aight. Hopefully we see more diverse personalities than one-note characters with 1 specific quirk, like Demon Slayer.

The story is well written. Very unique too and is sometimes even fourth wall breaking and can have a few jabs in the modern world as well, delivered by the future seeing Suwa. Times were tough in 1333, that’s for damn sure."
54724,539251.0,3.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Elusive Samurai has solid production values, exciting animation, and coloring at times—in fact, pretty often. Certain scenes remind me of a lavishly animated late 1990s or early 2000s OVA, acting as something like this generation's Hakkenden but with less artistry and a shonen rather than seinen mentality. There's plenty of corner cutting, however, whether it's the use of eye-poking CGI for characters, a slew of stills with motion lines or shaking, or Dezaki-styled ""postcard memories"" inserts. Nonetheless, the animation is only exciting at a few points, mostly in the first half and a handful of fights later on. Though it's mostly a pretty standard shonenin tone, certain scenes have an arthouse flair, pairing well with the emotions expressed. They especially do a great job of capturing the exhilaration of combat, as the main weaves around arrows and flips past swishing swords, or the backgrounds come alive in an abstract rush of color as he acrobatically makes his way to his destination. The art is usually vivid, sans the occasionally murky surroundings or a shoddy drawing here and there. The character designs for the little tots and cackling villains are distinct, and there's occasionally some decent action. 

The comedy is mostly obnoxious or plays upon awkward shotacon pandering that is the sanitized otaku equivalent of a white van with no windows and heaps of free candy or lost puppies. The scene where the MC meets the priest (uh oh) on the tree is one of the shrillest, loudest scenes in anime—a truly impressive feat! There's no way one can take this seriously in the beginning, for even when the tears rain down from the MC's googly eyes, and he has lost hope because his clan has been massacred, they pull the same slapstick comedy routine with absurd faces, bulging eyeballs about to pop a la Graves' disease, and the unbearable screeching of ten year olds and shining manchildren! I'd honestly say it's on par with the tone-deaf comedy of Demon Slayer; poking fun at tragedy and drama dynamics can work well, but the humor is usually oozing with unwanted tropey animeisms that are forced into the script as part of the shonen model rather than meshing well. Fortunately, the series becomes lighthearted and whimsical instead of playing it up as a hammy dark drama, and even the oftentimes gruesome blood sprays and gore explode into cartoonish chaos, so the tonal clashes aren't too pronounced, and the humor does mellow overtime. 

While the concept is acceptable for a story, the execution is less than stellar, and the themes, script, story, and characters are where this series is weakest, flailing like cement clown shoes into Japan's deepest lake. There's your typical quick introduction to a samurai clan, followed by rivers of blood, and finally a bunch of pint-sized heroes rising up to lead an army and save the day. The story meanders around without aim, gradually introduces the bloated cast of thin characters who barely register as archetypes, and shows their special abilities and potential, which means a touch of espionage, a big battle or two with cavalry and soldiers, numerous solo battles, and a whole lot of slinking off into the night with their tails between their legs.

The MC lacks proficient combat skills, but he can run away like a champ, while finding many opportunities to lecture adults and inculcate them in the art of retreat. By shonen standards, he's serviceable, foregoing the blockheaded idealism or obliviousness of plenty of others. His traumatic past informs his thought process, and his capabilities grant him with a balanced set of strengths and weaknesses, resulting in more tension and growth than the most bargain bin of shonen. The rest of the characters are basic, and when the MC remarked that he didn't know who Shizuku was because she seemed so mysterious and steeped in the arcane, it reminded me that I could say the same about even the simple Jacks of the cast, most of whom I can't remember the name of. The villains, though similarly lacking nuance, are a bit more entertaining, as they're often sadistic dirtbags, like the traitorous uncle who split too fast, or the eye-bulging archer Sadamune, or even the monkish samurai with literal ants in his pants who has a rare character arc. 

It could have been a 4-5 in the middle to late portion of the series, but it's so mediocre as it goes on and has a bland final arc, lacking the polish and thrill of the visual elements in the earlier portion of the series. There's not much else to say. It's just a dull shonen with a sloppy-taco story and plain-riceball characters. There are bursts of stylistic excess, but they aren't impressive enough to maintain much interest for those who have seen the most celebrated visual works in anime, which is a huge problem because that's the only thing this show has going for it."
54724,539703.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I had to wait to see the whole season before I could give this series a fair shake. It tries to do a lot of things, and some it does better than others. In the long run though, I was very pleased with most of this. The artwork is what initially caught my attention. Bright and powerful, to muted and depressing, the scenes are all very well done indeed. Some nice background work. They played around and experimented with the animation quite a bit. Sometimes it kind of sucked, with some so-so 3D rendering. But most of the time it was well done, and acouple episodes I found magnificient; like Demon Slayer levels of magnificient. Kudos! It could have used a little more consistency, but it all comes out in the wash as very well done. Be aware this series is not afraid to toss lots of gore around. I found it wonderful, but it might be too much for those of sensitive nature. 

The character designs have some interesting artwork for both protags and antags. The MCs and his retainers get nice features and colors. Some of the side characters are a little over the top, to the point of being goofy looking. Still, they seem to fit the high-spirited semi-comic vibe the producers were going for. 

The character writing was mostly good, with one HUGE exception. The MC and his retainers are all treated well by the writers. I thought the antagonists were a little too villianous, to the point of being comic. The huge exception is the priest. OMG, especially in the first haff of the season, he is so annoying, Wanted to reach into my screen and slap him. The writers start to take him a bit more seriously as time goes on though. 

The VAs were kind of all over the place, from being really good, to so overacted they were laughable. I greatly got the impression this was a direction flaw though, trying to inject dumbness as some sort of humor. So while it wasn't a total put off, there was a lot left to be desired, And one thing the director did get right was use of the sound. It was used to enhance scenes nicely.

I couldn't evade that I liked this a lot more than other recent samurai/shonen titles. If I was grading, this it's a very high B+ at 89/100. If that damned priest had been killed off by the 2nd ep, I'd probably have given this an A-"
54724,538964.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"The Elusive Samurai – A Review The Elusive Samurai was a pleasant surprise for me. I started watching it randomly, without recommendations or prior knowledge—just clicked and began. At first, I didn’t think I’d enjoy it. The opening seemed quite childish, filled with jokes, quirky characters, and the classic innocent protagonist overflowing with kindness. I’ve become somewhat saturated with that trope. However, I must be honest—I was misled by my own biases. This anime skilfully balances seriousness with humour, blending various art styles, from sketchy to 3D, in a magnificent way. I watched all 12 episodes in just two days because it was so enjoyable and light-hearted, leavingme wanting more.

There are numerous references to current memes that are genuinely funny. The humour is impressively woven into the context of war, executed flawlessly by the writers—kudos to them!

It’s worth noting that the series carries philosophical and religious undertones regarding short- and long-term actions and how we impact others, even when it seems counterintuitive at the moment.

What a delightful experience this was! I had never heard of this title or studio before, but they created a remarkable work of art. I’m glad I gave it a chance and watched it."
54724,538753.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Cloverworks have made a name for themselves with shows that blend action and comedy and I really think Nigewaka is up there with their very best work. Samurai stories are extremely popular right now thanks to the success of series like Ghost of Tsushima and Shogun, so getting a new historical series where we see the incremental development of an exiled prince into a legendary rebel samurai is awesome. As an history enthusiast, I enjoyed seeing so many figures from Japanese history brought to life as well as one of the most interesting periods in Japanese history. That coupled with some of the best productionvalues of the year and you’ve got an amazing experience. Highly recommend this one for action fans, fans of historical series or shotacons who are here for Tokiyuki. 

So I came into this having never read or seen Assassination Classroom, the author’s previous work. Crazy, I know, but I had no idea how good a writer the author was. This guy is truly amazing with creating characters and worlds that you fall in love with. The first episode does an amazing job of pulling you into this world and lulling you to sleep with a false sense of security only to hit you with one of the craziest tonal shifts you’ll see. I knew from that moment that this was going to be one of the best shows this year and I’ve been pushing the agenda ever since. This period of Japanese history is full of political instability, violence, betrayal and stuff that would make George R Martin’s books look like fairy tales. While nigewaka has a comedic angle to it thanks to supporting characters like Suwa, I still felt it did a good job of showcasing just how treacherous and dangerous a time this was. Tokiyuki goes through a ton of challenges that make him grow up really quickly. His journey is compelling and you can’t help but want to see him succeed given what happens to his family and by who. 

Now, I will say I was a tiny bit disappointed that the story goes off into the supernatural after the first episode. I was really hoping for a Japanese Vinland Saga style set up with some comedy and incredible Cloverworks animation after the spectacle that was the ending of the first episode, but they ended up going off on this time travel/supernatural vibe. That’s not the end of the world for me, I just would’ve preferred a more grounded approach. I did still have a ton of fun with it and think the way they incorporated the mystical aspects was solid.

The best part of this series is Tokiyuki’s connections with his subordinates. As part of his training to become a leader worthy of Japan, he has to hone a variety of skills from archery to espionage to general combat and there’s someone he recruits to the party along the way to help with each of those tasks. The author has a way with character interactions. They all felt so alive and dynamic, every scene with Tokiyuki and the elusive warriors was a trip, and we also see him grow substantially as a result of the various connections he makes. Retaking a country from someone with superior numbers and finances is no easy task so having a variety of people on your side who challenge you with different viewpoints and ways of doing things is a big plus. The emphasis this series has on conducting an insurgency as opposed to a direct conflict against the enemy is really cool to me too. 

Speaking of said enemy, the antagonist in this series, Ashikaga Takauji is absolutely terrifying. He is exactly the sort of villain I’ve been looking for in anime for a while. None of that sad backstory sob bs. Just give me a guy who is pure evil, cold, calculating and can still charm people. Now, while Ashikaga existed in real life, in the context of the show they haven’t explained what his actual rationale for betraying Tokiyuki’s family is so I’m waiting for that in a potential season 2. There was a lot of set up in these 12 episodes that we just unfortunately didn’t get answers to as is often the case for these one cour manga adaptations, but from what we got in this season I was very impressed.

The first episode of Nigewaka had some of the most unique animation and art you’ll see in anime. Absolute masterclass from Cloverworks. The rest of the season varies from incredible to.. kinda meh.. there’s a few episodes that rely heavily on CGI that just doesn’t look very good. Obviously every episode can’t look like episode 1, so I’m ok with a little stinker here and there, but on the whole they did an amazing job. I certainly feel like this is up there with their very best stuff. 

If you’re on limited time and just get an opportunity to watch a handful of anime from time to time, I think this is one of the ones from this season you need to check out. It’s a cool historical story with a fantastical twist, great action, great characters, funny as hell AND a little shotacon action if you’re into that type of thing. Nigewaka’s an experience I won’t soon forget and I’ll definitely be reading it!

54724,538749.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"The Elusive Samurai - Hello, my dear students, now's the time to get assassinated once again...but this time, embossed in actual history, to experience yet another comedic adventure? I sure hope so that's the case... If you didn't know any better, historical AniManga are now once again on the rise thanks to the major successes of series like Kusuriya no Hitorigoto a.k.a The Apothecary Diaries, and if there is any indication to go by, I wish that this will become a recurring trend for the numerous seasons and years to come. And from the courtesy of mangaka Yusei Matsui, the author of one of AniManga's mostrevered, juggernaut series of the 2010s: Ansatsu Kyoushitsu a.k.a Assassination Classroom, comes his latest Weekly Shonen Jump series of Nige Jouzu no Wakagimi a.k.a The Elusive Samurai, a series that hearkens back to Feudal Japan, and makes it look like a joke as much as possible. But the series winning the Shogakukan Manga Award in its 69th edition alongside Sousou no Frieren, Sūji de Asobo, and Trillion Game (which is getting an anime next season) this year (2024)? It's no joke.

The series being set in the Nanboku-cho North and Southern Courts period, is loosely based on the historical figure of Hojo Tokiyuki, a samurai of the Hojo clan whose father was Takatoki, the de facto ruler of the Kamakura Shogunate in the year 1333. It depicts the real-life battle of the 1333 Siege of Kamakura, being a part of the civil Genko War (also known as the Genko Incident) fought between the country's 96th Emperor Go-Daigo and the de facto military government from 1331 to 1333. Led by the first-generation Ashikaga Shogunate under the Emperor's orders, the elder brother of Takauji leads the charge in overthrowing the Hojo clan, forcing the lead figure, now shrunk down to a young boy, to escape to safety and certainly from beheading from the ursurpers. With his only help being a self-proclaimed, shady, prophetic priest, alongside similarly aged young kids that would prove their loyalty to restore the Kamamura Shogunate to its former glory, Tokiyuki must venture a dangerous path to ensure that his reputation does not warrant the death-defying trait that he's known for: his superhuman ability to flee, hide, and dodge enemy attacks. That's like an elusive person through and through.

Right out of the gate, the anime means business, and if clean, swift, silent, and deadly samurai katana swipes don't mean anything to you, the elusive dropping of human heads, splashes of blood, and endless juxtapositions will. There's a reason why Japan's rich and very dramatic history just makes for some great content, and Yusei Matsui taking real-world events to add his own Assassination Classroom twist, it's just genius. The abstracts of clean settings that contradict the reality of the situations being total gruesome bloodshed with or without tears, shit can get real pretty quick, and the way that this show does its survivability and deaths is so seamless to the point where ""don't blink, and you'll miss a beat."" All of this, despite being a Shonen series in general, was quite the game-changer when the manga came out as a brand new Shonen Jump work in January 2021, and quoting from CBR's Anthony Gramuglia, the series has become ""one of the highlights"" of Weekly Shonen Jump (at the time), that it is not only surprisingly emotional but also surprisingly intense, starting with all cylinders at full-throttle and never letting up."" If anything, this is an excellent rendition of foretelling the story of the 1333 Siege of Kamakura, in the classic Shonen way that Yuusei Matsui only knows how to do by inserting his sense of humour that, for better or for worse, you could be a total joker in awe for seeing apparitions of Koro-sensei and the Kunugigaoka Middle School's dropout Class 3-E with Nagisa Shiota and his classmates.

And that, brings me to the main meat of the show itself: the characters. With Hojo Tokiyuki and his escapee saviour of military commander Suwa Yorishige, the latter boasting that he could see the future, he's technically not wrong, as it's revealed that he has the spirit of Suwa Myōjin inside him, which makes him a god. Furthermore, history dictates that like the Hojo Clan, the Suwa clan also faces opposition with the fall of the Kamakura Shogunate, facing its own opposition in the Shinano Province, which ultimately forced them to support the already-decimated Hojo Clan with Tokiyuki at the helm, so it's a ""tour de force"" of near-extinct communities bonding together to face against a formidable common foe that extends all the way up to the Emperor. Speaking of Assassination Classroom then, this show does have its pick of period-accurate ""class-sized"" students through its aptly-named The Elusive Warriors band of youngsters: Yorishige's adopted daughter of the shrine maiden and logistics expert Shizuku; the swordsman and woman of Nezu Kojiro and Mochizuki Ayano who accompanies Tokiyuki to aid him in their military expertise; the mischievous thief of Kazama Genba who operates by money and fear with his disguise tactic; as well as the dual-sword wielding ronin of Fubuki who joins their rag-tag Kamakura restoration team after a scuffle that leads the former to trust his gut instinct after Tokiyuki has proven himself, this is a retainer group that can easily match up against Feudal Japan's lead figures. And the young-aged brats they are as a group of 5 kids, are just as (if not more) effective as a big-sized army who has to follow instructions to their ""sacrificial"" deaths, more than suffering through the endless comedic banters of Shizuku's uncle, as well as the colourful display of enemies that range from demeaning to outright crazy.

And as if you NEED any reason to believe all of the insanity that is the anime, its production values will shock you even further. There's no doubt that this is an Aniplex production, made solely because of well-known producer Shouta Umehara, who's done a lot at the Sony-owned studios of A-1 Pictures and (more recently) CloverWorks, the likes of Eromanga-sensei, Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru a.k.a My Dress-Up Darling and Bocchi the Rock! to name a few. The fact that this is a CloverWorks production, it's not just calling the A-1 Pictures' sister studio an imitation to begin with, but it's very clear that despite sharing resources within the same animation house, you can always bet on both studios banging out their adaptations like passion projects. From the uncanny but striking animations to flawless and interesting battles (e.g. Episode 9 is a classic Arifumi Imai masterclass) that you just can't help but be in awe of, the show is just crafted masterfully with the intention to surpass the manga in all regards, and it did. Despite the no-name storyboarder that is debut director Yuta Yamazaki, it's very clear that he wants to make a splash for a name recognition, and a recognition that he'll get for an insane job well done along with a capable staff team behind the anime.

Being a historical series, its OST has to be spot-on to reflect the history, and Akiyuki Tateyama (along with GEMBI) nailed the music aspect beautifully. I'd expect nothing less from the Yuru Camp a.k.a Laid-Back Camp series' music composer, and if there's one thing that he's good at, it's the comfy stuff, even if the action (i.e. as is the case for the Genjitsu Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki a.k.a. How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom series) unfortunately doesn't match up to his strengths. As for the theme songs themselves, this show does a competent job with DISH// and Botchi Boromaru having historically inspired songs that are just a delight to listen to and is worth endless repeats on end, especially the latter with its catchy bop of a Nanboku-cho-inspired rap song.

It's clear that Nige Jouzu no Wakagimi a.k.a The Elusive Samurai didn't quite turn out to be the success story that Yusei Matsui wanted to be, despite its increasing popularity as the years go by with the manga that, while is historically accurate, doesn't dive deep into the rich history that is the Kenmu Restoration period, much less the level of historical knowledge that is required out of the reader to fully understand what's going on in the manga replicating true stories. And if that doesn't get to you, neither will its writing be, that feels superficial at times than what we've come to expect from Assassination Classroom.

Ultimately, whatever your proposition will be, I think that the anime is pretty much necessitated to reinvigorate sales of the manga, and I hope it has done that to a degree that would help even overseas fans appreciate the series even more, even if reception in Japan has been lukewarm at best. I'm a sucker for historical stories, so this naturally comes recommended, but see if it does for you, either in seriousness or banter."
54724,539069.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"No matter how beautifully dressed something is, if it's a turd, it will always smell like a turd. It will taste like a turd, and you can't force me to eat it and pretend it's a cake. The premise of the anime starts out simple. Houjou Tokiyuki lives a carefree life until his life turns for the worse. His family was massacred, and he wanted to die. But he was saved by a priest and his daughter. This priest Suwa Yorishige, who can see the future to some extent, sees him as a leader who will grow to liberate Japan. From a seemingly innocent-looking anime,it starts to get dark quickly. 

Let me start with the positives. The character design is great. Not just Tokiyuki but others are distinctive enough, and this is its virtue because too many anime have forgettable character designs. 

Among all the action anime I watched this Summer of 2024, this has the best animation. By itself, it's a good reason to check this out.

But here's where it stinks. Some people view the gore and the violence as enough reason to classify this anime as mature, but I don't feel that way. Yorishige's lame humour as well as the fact that our main characters are children don't fit the tone of something 'dark and mature.' (Worse, I found the recap episode, which is more on the outstanding animation and less of the cringe humour better than this crap. I rated this crap as 5 [mixed feelings], but the recap episode a 6 [marked as recommended].)

Compare this with Rurouni Kenshin and Yatagarasu: 

1. Yatagarasu, an anime that started in Spring but also runs in summer, is seinen. It has the gravitas that I want in a dark and mature work. It has less of the violence of The Elusive Samurai, but it's infinitely better. 

2. I haven't seen the new Rurouni Kenshin, but I adore the old Rurouni Kenshin. RK is shounen. It has goofy humour like The Elusive Samurai, but they don't tell jokes when they are in battle mode. It has gravitas and you can tell that the world is not kid friendly.

So how do we judge this turd called 'The Elusive Samurai?' Its incongruent tone makes me think that it's a kids' show despite the violence and gore. The moral is that the world can be cruel and that it's not all rainbows and butterflies.

This is a fair enough assumption. The inner kid in me doesn't mind the violence. Nay, I would have enjoyed this anime when I was younger, and I think I would have rated this high when I was a kid and when I was someone this anime was made for.

Alas, it's not for me. I'll watch a season 2 if it comes but I'm not looking forward to it. Let me put on record the other action shounen anime in my watchlist — Failure Frame, Wistoria, and Why Does Nobody Remember Me in This World? They have issues of their own, but at least they feel that they were made for the older segment of the shounen demographic that the inner teenager in me enjoyed them far better than this turd. 

In conclusion, it's worth watching just to see the animation, but not all will enjoy seeing this. I certainly didn't. It's a kids' show masquerading as a dark, mature show, and it is betrayed by the tone it presents to the world. If you're pressed for time, don't watch this. It's a beautifully dressed turd but a turd nonetheless."
54724,538773.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Hey, my 250th review on MAL. Time to mark the occasion with a solid series from this season. I consistently had a very good time watching this series. Obviously, one of the major factors for that is the absolutely excellent animation, which matches or exceeds some of the best of the year so far. The first two episodes in particular are an incredible showcase of styles, and while it would have been nice to see the series continue to produce such marvels, it never dipped too far below that point… save maybe in the last couple of episodes where I can see a lot more justOK CG animation and a couple of weird visual inserts that break up the flow a tad. The color palette was incredibly vibrant and the characters in their multitude of outfits made more quite the visual spectacle, particularly Tokiyuki and Yorishige who served as stand-outs in distinct and interesting ways.

And the characters were no slouches in the writing department, either. Tokiyuki is far from a shrinking violet despite his predilection to run away. If anything, he’s kind of a fight slut who gets off on evading and surviving by the skin of his teeth. Yorishige is pretty much a joy every time he’s on screen, embodying the Jester and Sage together. His elusive group has their own unique elements, but none of them have gotten the kind of exploration that makes them quite so interesting of yet. Meanwhile, while the antagonists are mostly one-note absurd specialists who get outwitted (not a bad way to do it and it keeps things interesting fight after fight), Takauji is outright fascinating. It’s still unclear what his whole deal is, but every bit of insight just makes this man feel every bit the existential threat he is. For more information on him alone, I’d gladly watch more of this series play out.

I know some people had trouble with the tonal shifts this season took, and while I get it, I can’t say I was bothered. The stark shift in the first episode certainly came as a shock, though I think that is to the show’s credit, as is its ability to keep up a lighter tone despite those events in later episodes. There’s a sense that Tokiyuki and his group exude an aura that keeps all the terrors of the world around them at bay, almost as though they’re eluding that darkness that threatens to swallow them whole. It’s the aspect of the plot that works best for me.

As for the narrative, it’s a little more humdrum, though it leads to some interesting clashes that resolve in unexpected ways. Of course, the plot armor of its leads is guaranteed to hold for now, and even with a long span of time leading up to the major conflict with Takauji, there’s little sense that it will wane as Tokiyuki gathers warriors to his side. That makes some of this feel like it’s on rails, which holds it back a bit. It’s a fun ride, to be sure, but with the narrator’s and Yorishige’s foresight, there isn’t much reason to worry for these characters in the short run. The worldbuilding is only peeking around the edges so far, and while it’s gotten opportunities to do so that look beautiful, it lacks some depth as a result. In general, this season feels like it’s still building these characters up from very early stages, so it suggests more payoff than it actually delivers.

Overall, it’s a solid series that remains among my favorites of the season, even if it slipped down the rankings substantially over time. It’s a fun ride that looks like it’s going places, it’s just taking its time getting there. For now, it lives on the edge of greatness for me. Really hope it gets a second season, otherwise I’ll have to pick up the manga."
54724,539036.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Picked this one up after seeing some clips from the first episode, while it definitely didn't peak there, the quality isn't consistent like that for the whole season. There are a good bit of really really well animated sequences in this anime, knock my socks off good, but then there are also parts where they just blatantly switch to CGI animation, its a real whiplash effect and really unfortunate. Then the story itself is really not all that interesting so far, I'm willing to let it slide a little bit because it does feel like a set up period for the main arcs that areto come because most of this season just felt like recruitment and training with some really well animated fights sprinkled in. Here's hoping that the story comes out on top in later seasons."

﻿
I liked the opening, I normally don't comment on this in my final considerations, but I liked the opening.
﻿
I can see very good development for the next season if they don't give such a big timeskip, I hope that if it's going to be a maximum of 3 years and nothing more, delaying it a little would be good,
I don't know the size of the universe (the kingdom in question that they are fighting for) so I can't say how much still has to be presented to us, but I wish it didn't end with a second season and had a third, I'll watch the manga and hope it doesn't get rushed, But I really liked how the episodes went.
﻿
I consider it to be an 8+ for anime that I liked and would recommend to other people, so I leave it at 8, if I could leave it at 7.50 I would, I still felt that there was a lack of more animation, fights that could come in a second season. and I hope they make a good fight animation, the studio is good so there is no lack of potential.

I believe that with a good second season the first will be consolidated with an 8 rating, bringing new people to watch and some reevaluating their rating"
54724,539025.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"This anime was FUN as hell. I cant lie I thought this would just be something I throw on int he background and dont pay attention to. The main premise ""Leader who is good at running away"" intrigued me, but I didnt think I'd get hooked. RIght about episode 3 or 4 I decided this was one of my favorites. The main character is a classic shonen. He has presence and pride and a drive to reach his goal. Could swap him out with Tanjiro from Demon Slayer and you wouldnt notice much of a difference. One of the strengths int his show are int heside characters. The retainers (2 blue haired boys, specifically) are really interesting to me. I love how theyre all slowly learning to be a revolutionary force.

There is an element of the super natural, here. With the future telling priest and the presence of gods / demons that help augment peoples skills. I cant wait for season 2 and Im going to start reading the manga to explore more of the lore.

Last point - it is beautifully animated. Dont put this on in the background. You have to pay attention to really see all the great art"
54724,539852.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I feel like this show deserves more recognition but at the same time I do recognize elements of it that would drive people away. It's not for everyone but if it's for you then you will enjoy it quite a bit. Cloverworks handled the production side of things very well. The visuals are pretty great but a lot of it is achieved through clever use of different artstyles and angles. The show has a lot of energy and drive both in terms of visuals and pacing (although it does slow down closer to the end). The nagative side of production is occasional CG modelsand while it's good CG, you will notice it and it does feel a bit weightless at times especially when weapons are involved.

 Now, the controversial part is the tone. At first it was a bit jarring going from lighthearted, wholesome stuff to blood and death (and the show doesn't have much chill when it comes to violence) but as soon as I noticed that different characters react to these tonal shifts differently, it kinda made sense. Also. it's an era when death often doensn't come from old age and it makes sense for characters close to fighting to not be too phased by it. Still, because of those tonal shifts the overall impression the show creates is rather lighthearted despite the occasional limb getting detached... Or maybe it's just me..."
54724,538956.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"**The Elusive Samurai** To start with this is easily the best show of the season and immediately kicks itself into my ""things I would tell someone to watch besides it being a seasonal"" category. In other words, I will be listing this as 10/10 on the two anime tracking sites I use (anilist mal). This show is *very me* taking place after the end of the Kamakura period and firmly integrates itself into this historical setting. It's full of little historical tidbits that are really fun to learn if you look after the episodes and fine to let slip past you. The animation quality hereis stellar with a fruitful blend of bright colors and the dark mudiness you would expect of war being contrasted against each other in a very impactful way. The titular ""Elusive Samurai"" is also highlighted though this well deserved budget which his movements feeling unthinkable if done any other way as he playfully dances around the battlefield. 

Character designs are also extremely well done with even mob charecters feeling very memorable even after short appereances. (I now know multiple minor imperial officials by name!). 

The comedy isn't always for me but this is something I will not hold against it as I am not the target demo for Japanese Shonen comedy. I will however note that some of the jokes I did find a decent amount funny which I found to be surprising. 

Women charecters have some presence in the show but like many other members of the genre you an already feel them being sidelined by the 12th episode. There isn't much explicit misogyny but this is obviously unfortunate. This and Genba's pervert bit (Why does every show have this!) are probably it's weakest aspects. I don't think you should take this to mean there are no important female charecters as there are still 2 members of the band that are women fighters. Certainly a better track record than Naruto or DBZ."
54724,538896.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"The Elusive Samurai is truly a treat for those like myself who love an anime's art and animation style most that pulls you in-- and man does this anime do just that. It's as if the animators and artists were told to go wild. So many times where you'll find yourself entranced by the vivid colorfulness of it all, the flashy designs, the wild over the top animation... not to mention certain sequences that were simply masterful ways of using this medium unlike any other. It's a visual feast and what makes it such a special gem this season. Ignoring... the occasional CGI of course. Theanimators REALLY don't like animating people on horseback apparently. 

Story and character wise, it starts strong and pulls you into the plight of the young protagonist. Pushed into a role he never wanted, nor did he truly see himself fit for this new world he was living in after the fall of everything. He's lost so much, but he's also promised a lot more should he decide to stand up and make a change instead of joining his fallen people. The protagonist grows a lot over his journey and is met with a colorful cast of supporting characters willing to join him on his journey to becoming a proper lord. Some of these supporting cast however... especially the first two helpers in battle simply aren't given any spotlight on why they want to help whatsoever. They're there to fight! For what motivation or past reasons however? Dunno. Maybe that will come much later.

The biggest hindrance to the anime thus far is the shoved in ""comedic"" moments. Yorishige Suwa is the biggest moment ruiner of all and was the biggest reason many of my watching companions ditched this anime. He's great when he's serious and acting the proper leader/helper that he is. But he constantly, consistently, makes phony jokes to do with the ""modern age"" and ""future"" to try and get a chuckle out of the audience. Horribly forced and takes away from the focus a lot. If there were a reason for me to give this review with mixed feelings, it would solely be because of him.

Past that though. There's great potential in the Elusive Samurai.  People who love watching anime based on Japan's older eras will likely enjoy this. Even if there are parts that I lament, I find this anime to be a special hidden gem this season. And, if anything else, fun eye candy for those that can appreciate the art, animation, and music that went into this colorful production."
57058,537639.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"In 1959, the sociologist C. Wright Mills published a monograph titled ""The Sociological Imagination."" The titular concept purports to draw a connection between the individual's personal experience and the social world—that is, how the social world affects the individual. Noor, the protagonist, is viewed by many as a bumbling idiot who parries everything, brain cells included. Some see this as charming gag humour, while others see it as a trope that wears out its welcome in a few episodes. Everyone is right. But I'd like to expand upon this and invite the enterprising viewer to approach the show with Mills's concept of the sociological imagination inmind, especially for anyone who might be turned off by the idea of a ""stupid MC who never learns.""

Have you ever had your world-view absolutely shattered overnight? What about your sense of identity? Yes, this is anime, so unrealistic things are allowed to happen, but still: place yourself in Noor's shoes. He yearns to become an adventurer and live the tales he's read about, but all his life he's known nothing but failure. So when he finally achieves something—becoming an adventurer qualified for only the most menial tasks—he latches onto this identity like a starving leech. It's honest work, and Noor is well-appreciated by the people he helps; so, for him, it feels right.

Suddenly he's thrown into insane situations for which he feels entirely unprepared. The reality is that his extreme training regimen and subsequent aptitude for his limited skill-set has made him more than qualified to handle everything that comes, but he has no reason to think this. He lacks context and perspective that we (and the other characters) possess. He doesn't even have the arrogance or narcissism to recognize his own strength or consider alternatives that would place him at the top of the food chain. Consequently, Noor is very slow to expand upon his old identity as an exceedingly low-rank adventurer who's failed in every way to advance.

""I Parry Everything"" is not a show for everyone, but if you are able to look past Noor's idiosyncrasies (and the rather standard story and animation), then I would encourage you to approach the show with an open mind and willingness to see the protagonist as more than just an idiot. Doubly so for those who enjoy an older protagonist + teen girl having a wholesome relationship without a shred of romantic subtext, something that is far too rare in anime."
57058,537626.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"I Parry Everything - 3 words, 1 show, simple to understand...except for the brain. I know, I know...long LN titles (vice versa on both Japanese and English titles) and the like bores us to tears, since most of them end up being at best decent to at worst, mediocre to plain bad. But there's a chance to think of a ""what if"" situation where one or the other could just have a short title and be very descriptive to the T. And my friends, that's exactly the scenario for novelist Nabeshiki's Ore wa Subete wo ""Parry"" suru: Gyaku Kanchigai no Sekai Saikyou wa Boukensha ni Naritaia.k.a I Parry Everything: What Do You Mean I'm the Strongest? I'm Not Even an Adventurer Yet!, or just simply shortened to ""I Parry Everything"". But hoo boy, there's a love-hate relationship going on for this series, and it all has to be blamed around its titular MC.

There's always an unwritten rule when it comes to fantasy series, Isekai or otherwise: let your main character at least have a personality. Don't care if he's an OP god/spirit-given freak or a harem king/queen, at least let him/her be presentable to the audience to judge in criticism and likability, and at least have a trait that'll be representative not just towards, but around the MC to find interest and stick around for the long run. Yet, here's the series' forefront MC: Noor, a character who acts like an NPC being a village bumpkin, who suddenly got approached by a GM telling him that he can go out to the world and become an adventurer just because he's the strongest, who then vanishes out of sight and leaves him without a tutorial stage into the conquest of becoming a remarkable person. His only lone skill, ""Parry,"" is essentially a OP-certified defence skill, but that's only when he tried to be like everyone else, and failed horribly to the point that he's a talentless person, with all that strength accumulated as he tries to be like the adventurers that he so admire, not realizing that it's basically a skill buff that constantly levels up his Parry skill. Worse, he lacks common sense and social cues due to his living conditions as a bumpkin, always causing misunderstandings to the people around him, even after trying to make some sense that he'll actually never get it. All in all, more than a literate walking plot device, Noor's a superhuman with an inept EQ, for better or for worse.

But things change when he Parries his way to saving a girl and her guards out of trouble, and that girl turned out to be a noble royalty figure: Princess Lynneburg of the Kingdom of Clays. What was supposed to be the young princess's coming-of-age trial turned out to a ""Opposites attract"" of a meeting where Noor literally parries a fearsome monster to defeat it, and being nobility, Lynne wants to thank her saviour, but Noor doesn't feel justified and vows to work harder. Eventually, by hook or by crook, Lynne manages to force Noor into her bidding to see her father the King to grant him a reward, and the unkempt-looking Black Blade sword that he once used during his days as an adventurer was given to him, regardless of if he likes it or not. And even then, Noor remains humble that it's just perchance that he's able to save Lynne's life, which she thinks that Noor is more than meets the eye, and the King allows her to venture her coming-of-age journey together with Noor.

Let's not beat around the bush: Noor is quite the idiotic character who has little to no EQ at all, and there's a limit to how far you can actually push a trope such as this, though in Nabeshiki's case, he was quite excessive with the trope enough since it actually makes for content farming. And as much as I would hate that this becomes an annoyance in the wrong situations, it actually works for some subtle humour coming from the airheaded question mark of an insanely strong MC. Where Noor may not shine in the intellectual department, he definitely does in the physical aspect, being too OP-ly strong to the point that while he's completely unaware of the insanity of his Parry skill, he more than makes up for situations that call for it, with kingdom wars and the like, because, let's face it: Noor literally CAN Parry Everything with the acid-bloated Black Blade of a huge sword. As if Lynne is any better, where Noor thrives on being braindead since he comes from the prairies, her royal upbringing practically shields her out of the outside world, becoming just as airheaded as the former himself. And the ""Opposites attract"" theming goes hand-in-hand between both characters enough so much so that wherever they go, misunderstandings always occur without fail, some to pure annoyance, and others to pure hilarity, such as with Noor and the spearman Gilbert testing his skills to see if his Parry-ing does come through in ability, though the assumptions quickly take over that Gilbert thinks he has the ego over the weak Noor who thinks that he cannot defeat the spearman with his inept strength, labelling himself as a talentless and someone who's only good at doing NPC-like jobs, like using Black Blade to clean the dirty sewers.

I tell you, either this guy has a brain full of retardedness, or a heart full of compassion enough that he just fights for the sake of matching people's expectations. But if there's a commonality, Noor's a walking enigma, misconceptions and all.

The production values are decent, as one would come to expect from OLM with basically serviceable animation and hints of Sakuga from time to time. The music is easily forgettable, as well as Utahime Dream's OP and ED theme songs, nothing is notable.

What Ore wa Subete wo ""Parry"" suru a.k.a I Parry Everything is, will solely come down to this one defining trait: Will Noor's Forrest Gump-level of intellectually disabled dense/dumb stupidity, parry the watch factor of the series? That's not for me to decide, since this is more or less about the same ""Comedy is Subjective"" level of audacity that's all to say about the show and its literal character-driven plot. Like the masses, I did get annoyed pretty quick on Noor's level of studpidity, but it's also the same reason why this series even works at all in the first place. It's a give-and-take exchange of the immaculate kind that you can't explain why, but you just subconsciously want more of it to see just how much the sky's the limit when it comes to his Parrying.

I Parry Everything is not bad at all, but it's definitely an exercise in frustration, and if this is your kind of show, I'd say: Go for it, you have nothing to lose. You'll end up learning Parrying a lot better,"

There are a lot of different translations of the title but I’m gonna use this one. . We have Noor our MC a orphan who wants to be an adventurer but he is not able to learn any kind of magic or fighting style after this he give up on his dream and become a worker in the town who helps people. Tho he has one talent and its Parrying. He devolves it while trying to be adventurer. One day he sees Clayswho is in danger and saves her with he’s ability and accidentally become her teacher.

Its doesn’t sounds bad right? An MC who has only one talent but very good at it. Very typical. But there is one think. Its the fact the MC is the stupidest person in the world and when I say stupidest I mean it. He is not naive or uneducated which in he's situation would be normal but no he is just stupid. He doesn’t understand anything. Like if he see a man with a gasoline and lighter in front of burning house. He somehow would assume that this man try to stop the fire. This gonna happen every episode more than one time it doesn’t helps that the other characters are dumb too. He doesn’t understand how powerful he is even tho its obvious as much as that you need to breath to stay alive. He can literally win the fight with god and still gonna say that he is pretty average on talent. Im not gonna lie him being the stupidest person in the world made like 2-3 scene good but its just too much for me.

The side cast was mostly boring nothing good or bad. The prince and Ines mostly carried the side cast. On the other hand Clays who is the second main character was just unnecessary. Yea she is there , yea she has healing magic and some other tricks but other than that she was there to proof that no we are not schizophrenic and he is actually very strong. Well why Im acting like she is better than him? She is not as dumb as Noor but 'delusional' is her second name. She just doesn’t understand that Noor thinks that he is not strong. She is literally gonna make a whole other scenario in her head. 

As the story it was alright at start ,not good just okay. But towards the end especially the last 3-4 ep it was just bad. Too much happening but nothing at the same time especially the last ep was straight up unnecessary.

The animation is decent enough for mediocre fantasy anime dont remember saying wtf is this to the screen.

Who should watch it? Even tho I didnt like it Im sure some people gonna enjoy him being stupid and gonna find it funny. But if you like common sense in MC stay away for it. You can still check it its your typical Fantasy anime just with the dumbest person in the world"
57058,538609.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Its hard for most anime watchers to like this because the main character is an adult, there are no cringey immature jokes, and it has zero fan service shots, so there isnt much for the average weeb to enjoy. Every 10 year old's complaint is ""hurr durr main character is dumb"". but so are lots of other popular characters is anime (goku, luffy, naruto, asta, etc). The main characters zero awareness is the main part of the comedy. it wouldnt be funny anymore without it. If you cant get over that you have the mental development of a child. The mc is humble caring hard working guywho doesnt once stare at the ass or tits of any of the female characters which also dont show any romantic interest towards him. Seriously its so refreshing to find an anime without harem, sexualized characters and fans service shots.
The story isnt very original but the above average animationg quality and excellent directing more than makes up for it. Seriously. One of the best things about the show is that something actually happens in every episode. A major fight/action scene or plot point happens every episode. none of that blueballing bullshit where they creat tension before a major scene and then stop the episode and have to wait another week to see what happens. Yet still i've never in my life wanted so bad to see more, each time i finished an episode.
Its become one of my favorite shows and I cant help but recommend it to everyone i know that likes anime."
57058,538081.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"What do we have here? An MC who can fend off anything, yes anything! Including his own brain! For the initial concept, this anime could actually be a good anime, the struggle from childhood and without talent until finally being able to have various powers from people in general. But unfortunately, the author actually made the MC look stupid. For example, when the MC fights a strong Goblin, but according to him it is a weak Goblin, not only that, but the views of the people around him also consider the MC to be a strong figure. But in MC's own mind he is the weakest, because he doesn'thave any talent.

Actually, this is still quite reasonable, because the MC lives in a remote area and only from stories does he know about strong creatures, for example Goblins, He didn't know the strong Goblins and the ordinary Goblins.
But the main factor is not there, because this MC already looks very mature or we could even call him an uncle.
If the MC is this mature, at least he realizes that what he is fighting is actually very strong, and by being able to survive or defeat the enemy, the MC should be able to realize that he is strong!
But unfortunately, just like I said before, the author made the MC's behavior too stupid! I think it really doesn't suit his appearance as he's an old man but his intelligence level is very low!"

This anime has almost brought a new restored hope in the good of humanity, and while the MC is not real he reminds us that we can always choose the compassionate response to situations. The emotions of feeling the good in life and the stories of those around him recognizing his abilities without him knowing make this a truly interesting anime. Every episode provides a new challenge just like every day of life and yet the Mc finds a way to conquer each of those tasks without losinghis center. It truly resonates with that of everyday real life. Watch this for humor, fun, and to renew your own compassion."
57058,539311.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"I Parry Everything is a solid execution of a mediocre trope. It is not an Isekai but does rely heavily on JRPG mechanics such as Skills and the ever present Adventurers Guild. The basic setup for this series is that Noor is a boy who grows up in the outskirts of the capital and through some tragic events his parents die, but not before loving him very much and instilling the stories of Adventurer Heroes in his head. Noor has to learn to become self sufficient without his parents, then goes to the capital to become an adventurer. Unfortunately, Noor sucks at everything, and canonly achieve one skill in any of the major schools of adventuring including - The Parry. 

This show takes the spectrum of what 'parry' means and uses them all. Parry can mean a deflection of an attack, it can mean the disarming of a foe, it can be the blocking of an attack. Noor's parry can even be used as a ranged attack to disarm multiple opponents at a distance. This show takes wild liberties to what a Parry can actually do imbuing a large array of utility to a simple 'parry'. 

Noor himself, is the naive country boy trope. Country boy in a big adventure that he doesn't comprehend that he actually is in. The show is filled to the brim with misunderstandings, uncorrected assumptions, and interrupted clarity that keep Noor a very humble and simple minded hero for the duration of the series. 

Some will very much enjoy this comedic series of misunderstandings and constant confusion but others, like myself, will find it to be an onslaught of frustration that pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief. Noor constantly misidentifies monsters he's fighting because he has only heard vague and low level descriptions of what they should be. Any time someone tries to explain the actual scope of the situation to Noor they are conveniently interrupted.

The show continues this trend throughout its 12 episode run, and to give it credit - it rides this trope very well. There is heart to the story, but it is very simple as multi-episode arcs in the series usually only span a single day. Which means that the series clips along at a steady pace and doesn't waste a lot of time, which works in its favor as its not able to drag on jokes for too long, shoveling along its cast from story point to story point. 

I would recommend this to someone who enjoyed the silly flippant attitude of some older anime, especially in the 90s, but want more meat in it. I Parry Everything does have an over arching story that everybody, except the main character, is following very closely. So as Noor is able to entertain us with his antics and humble understandings, the rest of the cast carry the adventure forward full tilt as the capital faces a looming threat so large they could barely fathom its true scope until it hits them in the face. 

I Parry Everything is a fun romping adventure with high stakes, that usually become low stakes because of Noor, and prides itself in marrying naivete with heroism to a fault. I'd give this series a 5, but it did its job very well - leading to a solid 6 on my scale."
57058,538000.0,5.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"I Parry Common Sense. The premise of this show sounded interesting before I watched it. A non-isekai fantasy of a character that makes the best use out of a combination of low level skills, developing them into something useful. What I got was a run of the mill OP out the gate protagonist that is so dumb, he actually decreases the intelligence of everyone around him. There was a little bit of potential for interesting world building, I liked their take on one of the monsters, and the other empire, but it came along too late and didn't go into enough detail. Maybe there issome redemption in the LN, but nothing here.
The power scaling is so off the charts that I don't know how they could develop it further. The first 2 or 3 enemies are understandable and within the realm an overly developed 'low level' skill but after that it just goes off the rails. If they kept the same pace of increasing the MC's power then by the end of a season 2 i would expect to see the episode 'I Parry God'.
I think the best thing they could have done to save this series would have been to make it into a parody or comedy show, but as it is right now it takes itself too serious for what it is.
If you still want to watch the show, you should know by episode 3 if you can make it through it. If you're on the fence about finishing it after that then just watch 5, 11 &amp; 12. you're honestly not missing much by skipping the other episodes."

Don't be fooled by those who give bad reviews, they have bad taste, they like mainstream harem stories, They don't like to see Noru looking stupid, they don't know that Noru is an innocent person, living alone in the forest and rarely socializing, it's no wonder that Noru grows up to be a very innocent person. that makes sense. The story flows well like frieren, Noru doesn't suddenly become very strong, he develops little by little, even though he is strong, he is very humble just like Himmel which makes it interesting to follow. The storyfocuses on epic fights, one man army, saving the kingdom from war, especially when fighting dragons makes goosebumps, reminds me of Stark vs dragon in Frieren.

57058,537821.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"This parried my intelligence and made me have the intelligence of a caveman... ""I Parry Everything"" is mediocre. Plain & Simple. That isn't to say that this wasn't disappointing, but more-so this had immense potential that it consistently killed with each encounter with the bland and moronic MC that drains your IQ more than short format videos on YouTube and TikTok. Let me explain; 1. Noor is probably the most stupid & dense MC I have ever watched by a long shot: YES, I know that he is intentionally dense and stupid. But there are legitimately zero redeeming factors about this main character. I am being serious when Isay the cartoon ""Beavis &amp; Butthead"" has not only far more intelligent main characters, but they are actually stupidly funny, Noor on the other hand has zero funny comedy, he has a lower than room temperature IQ, and consistently is more dense than a neutron star.

2. HAD potential:
The first few episodes actually were alright, since it wasn't absolutely blatantly obvious how big of an idiot Noor was, you would just think he is a tad slow with picking up details, but he cant even understand what a detail even is. I cannot understate how dense Noor is, the amount the author made him dense is ridiculous. That said, at least at the beginning the characters had some charm to them, which I feel faded away after the fourth episode in this anime. What I mean is, the relationships Noor was making, was done at a reasonable pace, and after the fourth episode it then went on to be both overwhelmingly fast and slow at the same time, this being the fact that the story went by quickly with the people Noor would meet, but the dialogues were inorganic and slow which dragged on immensely especially with the emperor and his charade.

3. Very weird pacing:
Episodes 5 through 10 have pacing that could've made these five episodes into three if it's pacing was done better. This is a bit of a smaller nitpick, but I still dislike when some anime have drawn out episodes to make it to that 12 episode mark.

Things that were good;
1. The ending:
The ending was probably one of the best for a conclusion that I have seen this season. It is the one of the reasons that I still think this show might be worthwhile for some people.

2. The characters besides Noor are well constructed characters:
Kinda funny how all the other characters besides have a lot of likable charm isn't it? I am unironic when I say this, most of the other characters came off decently well constructed. This doesn't mean the other characters are complex (far from that), I just mean that they are simple and likable characters, which is nice when you have a clueless MC.

All in all, I think this anime really depends on if you care about watching a clueless &amp; stupid MC, and find enjoyment in the character's density, or if you dislike OP MCs.

6/10, watch if this is the type of show you are looking for."

The guy is just... stupid. Like, frustratingly stupid. He can't seem to think for himself, and what makes it worse is how confident he is in his cluelessness. I mean, if you think it's weird you should ask someone who knows better. I get that he didn't have his parents around growing up, but still, that doesn't really excuse the complete lack of basic thinking. The way his character is written, with zero common sense, reallystarted to grind on me after a while.

It's a refreshing take on the genre, especially because of the animation quality, and the lack of fan service. Sure, it's your classic OP MC who's mostly oblivious to his own strength, but if you're looking for a chill watch, it's perfect. The action scenes are solid, and the voice acting really delivers. I feel like some people are getting too frustrated with how unaware the MC is of his own power, but honestly, that’s part of the charm. He has determination and work ethic, even if he has absolutelyno situational awareness. It also leads to some funny moments when other characters interpret his actions.

Overall, just don't overthink it!"
57058,538499.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"""I Parry"" is a power fantasy story, and it doesn't hide that fact or shy away from it. Concept isn't anything unique; it's a ""I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times"" type of story, so general enjoyment relies on how you view that concept. MC is a dreamer who tried becoming an adventurer as a child but was told and shown that he was a failure and had no special talent or ability to do anything related. Instead of giving up, he decides to train little that he learned on his own in what could be described as isolation. When he managesto become the lowest of low handymen, he still readily takes on that task and feels somewhat fulfilled even if his dreams are only left to be dreams. 
As he is thrown into crazy situations lacking any knowledge of the world or politics in general, he still, in his mindset, is a failure, which plays partly the comedic role of the show. Critics would call him dumb and dense, but it logically makes sense; the guy literally came out of the woods with a shattered self-worth. 
Occasionally it's nice to watch stories about simple, good-natured heroes in a straight-forward setting, without harems, ecchi, or revenge/whatever plots. 
As the story evolves, situations become more and more nonsensical, which makes it funnier up to the end, where it might hint for another season. 

Out of nowhere, I enjoyed it much more than expected; this is the absurd show done right."

57058,540320.0,5.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Can He Really Parry Everything... But Can He Parry a Serious Review? I Doubt It! The story follows a classic adventure setting, situated in a fantasy world filled with monsters and magic. The main character has lofty ambitions, but they are quickly dashed due to his lack of, if not complete absence of, talent in various combat skills. These skills are essential for him to achieve his dream of becoming an adventurer. However, through time, hard work, and sheer determination, he manages to reach heights never before seen in this world. The protagonist is well-developed, both in terms of personal growth and how he evolves over the years.His motivations and inner reflections are also carefully explored. 

However, the main issue lies with his intellect. Sure, there are plenty of protagonists who are naive or not particularly smart, but this one aims to be an adventurer! He should at least have a basic understanding of how the world works—the guilds, the politics, or at the very least, the kingdom he lives in. Yet, he's depicted as a strong-hearted character with no real deductive skills. He constantly falls into clichés, with misunderstandings and missed cues leading to lucky resolutions.

The supporting characters, surprisingly, are well-developed and quite well-characterized, which isn't always a given in a mid-tier anime. Each has their own motivations and backstory, revealed through various flashbacks that help explain their choices and why they follow the protagonist. This is a positive aspect of the show. Overall, these characters are reasonably intelligent or at least average, which only makes the protagonist appear even more foolish and unprepared.

The narrative itself feels flat and lacks dynamism. It's obvious when something important is about to happen or when a high-stakes moment is approaching. This gives each episode the feeling of a standalone short story rather than a continuous narrative, which significantly diminishes the viewer's desire to keep watching.

Furthermore, the approach to combat, which should be the highlight of any adventure story, is a repeated series of tired and overused scenes. There's no innovation or alteration in the fight patterns, and even though the animations are fluid and the action sequences well-constructed, they eventually grow tiresome. The combat system is practically non-existent. The protagonist easily deflects attacks from basic weapons one moment and then effortlessly blocks magical strikes from heavy weapons the next, with no real explanation or context. The only reasoning seems to be: ""because he's the protagonist, and he can.""

Because of these significant issues with the storytelling, by the middle of each episode (if not earlier), it's already clear what will happen next, completely eliminating the curiosity that should be at the heart of an adventure series like this.

In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this anime—not because it's a terrible product. It clearly has a well-constructed world and solid supporting characters worthy of a sequel. But unfortunately, the protagonist, who should be the cornerstone of the narrative, falls short, as do the battles and their execution. For these reasons, I consider it a time-passer rather than a must-watch, given the sheer number of flaws. It's a mid-to-low-tier seasonal anime."
57058,539570.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Might be a real stretch but this anime kinda follows the same moral similarly with the film ""Whiplash"". A guy who gets better everytime he is discouraged, rejected and humiliated, to strive to become even more better no matter how harsh and cruel it might be, When his teachers did see potential in him they thought he was discouraged after his last rejection, but similarly the only way to survive and get better or stronger is to have the determination of what the greats have, like how in this anime is the ideal hero who never backs down, it is because they are harsh, their determinationis the ability to turn cruelty into fuel to strive to become better or stronger.

54913,538138.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"The Ossan Newbie Adventurer, Trained to Death by the Most Powerful Party, Became Invincible – When you grow up too late in life, there’s no such saying as “you’re too old to learn anything”. For “It’s never too late, for with a purpose, a worthy goal, and a motivation to reach those upper layers on the pyramid, a person can travel further in a few years than he might otherwise travel in a lifetime.” - Earl Nightingale If there’s one thing that I have learned through watching anime with the passing seasons and years, it’s the culmination of this one fact, quoted from Will Ferrell: “Nomatter how much you screw up your own life by the wrong decisions that you make, it’s never too late to do the right thing and change your ways, and you can teach old dogs new tricks.” And rightfully so, being a 30-year-old (not so) young adult who still feels like there is still some untapped potential left, the philosophies through hundreds and thousands of AniManga series that have come and gone have certainly taught me into becoming a better person each day. And such is the perfect case study of a show of novelist Kiraku Kirishima’s Shinmai Ossan Boukensha, Saikyou Party ni Shinu hodo Kitaerarete Muteki ni Naru. a.k.a The Ossan Newbie Adventurer, Trained to Death by the Most Powerful Party, Became Invincible, which other than the show dropping in one of the most defining years of my life hitting the Big 3, it’s also, in my very humble opinion, undoubtedly the best Ossan-esque series that we’ve had so far up until this point, even when you consider the stereotypical overpowered MC trope.

It’s a given that the best time to nurture skills is to start young, especially in a typical fantasy world where magic is king, and everything else is redundant in the pursuit to become an adventurer. However, sometimes people can blossom late in their lives, as if the fact to be taken by another show in the same season — Ore wa Subete wo ""Parry"" suru a.k.a I Parry Everything’s MC Noor, who flourished rather late, and was being deemed unworthy to be taught, even if he put all of his hard work into trying to make a living as a capable adventurer, no matter how long it takes for him to become one. In the scenario of this anime, Rick Gladiatol is just that character, who, like Noor, dreams of becoming an adventurer from his childhood days, but has to hold that dream off because of circumstances that don’t allow him to achieve what he wanted to be. And the bulky man, at 30 years of age, being a modest clerk at his town’s Adventurer’s Guild, takes his chances at trying to be a bona-fide adventurer by going through the usual style of preliminary tests to be certified as one. But of course, being old has most of the candidates all laughing at him for someone who starts so late that he shouldn’t be taken seriously as they should. But little do they know that despite the late blooming, Rick would become a tour de force to be reckoned with, trained by the world’s strongest party of S-ranked members for 2 years, such that his F-ranked status undermines a gruesomely hard-earned S-rank calibre to have everyone be taken so aback of an Ossan who could do the near impossible. This is Rick’s zero-to-hero story of how his affiliation with the S-rank party of Orichalcum Fist, sets off a chain of events that would see him go from a nobody to more than just being the adventurer of his dreams.

If you’re around the same age as I am, you can absolutely feel Rick’s devastation, partly from how his fantasy world’s magic is functioning a bit differently from what you expect of the stereotypical fantasy trope. Because, you see, the fantasy world where Rick and the others reside doesn’t allow their “Nature Composed Magic” talent to be manifested until the age of 20, which meant that Rick actually started his dream 12 years late (which brings us to the very start of the series). And the saying goes that once you hit that sweet spot of eligibility, the “early bird gets the worm,” as they say, to quickly develop skills that make you as powerful as you imagine to be. Not so for Rick, and as much as fate would have it, him being scouted by the S-ranked party of Orichalcum Fist’s Guillotine Swordmaiden of Reanette Elfeit to improve on his skills since his magical reserves weren’t as developed as they should be (and it must be done before the age of 30, which Rick has clearly surpassed), and that’s how he got literally trained to death by the most powerful party for the 2 years ever since to then participate in the adventurer prelims to be certified as one, though being invincible was never a case to begin with until the later moments in the series, which sees his fame rise.

Despite being purely an action-adventure fantasy series, there’s some comedy to be had here. One look at Orichalcum Fist itself should give you the idea that as funny as its eccentric 4-member party can be, they’re utterly serious when it comes to work, and they don’t let you off the hook so easily until you achieve what they want you to be. This is Rick’s daily torture for the 2 years since he joined the S-rank party, and their philosophy being that “hard work will produce results, even if it pushes you to the brink of death” may be harsh reality, with people like the dark elf Reanette (who serves as Rick’s assistant and companion); the monstrous physique and intelligence matching Sage Beast of warrior-monk orc Broughtston Ashore; the greatest weapon craftsman of Thousand-year Workshopper half-elf-dwarf hybrid Mizett Eldwarf; and the Demon Child of Devastation of genius vampire mage Alicerette Draqul all taking said Ossan on building his characteristics, man’s gotta hustle with coming close to near-death experiences quite a lot to constantly weep at death’s throes.

At least he knows that they’re doing it for his good, and with strength comes power that’s more than enough to face his rivals, such as the Diarmuit family of nobility, who proclaims power with the expected typical egoist high, almighty, and pompous behaviour. The comedy with Rick facing the trio of siblings of A-rank eldest Raster (who also serves as the adventurer prelims examiner), B-rank middle child Angelica (who is a 2nd-rank knight), and C-rank youngest Freed (who is the fist to challenge the Ossan thinking that he’ll be an easy one to defeat), I’ve got to say that I’ve experienced all sorts of comedy, but never one this unhinged where, unlike Noor, Rick at least knew his strength to weigh against those of higher ranks and treat them as fellow rivals vying for the same certification. At least for Angelica, she is the sole comedy relief of the series that I just can’t stop ROFL-ing at her misdemeanour, even after she got humbled really quick to serve as Rick’s servant and learning of his treatment at Orichalcum Fist to the point of hilarious disbelief of how he managed to survive the 2 years’ worth of hellish training, even if he dies and gets reincarnated time and time again. But I’ll give this about Angelica’s character: she is one of the reasons why this show works —from being taken down from her mighty chair to being humbled by Rick to see that his hard work, despite her inadequacy to also be trained by him regardless, proves that all-knowing talent is nothing in the face of putting in effort, NOTHING. I am proud of Rick, but I’m even prouder of Angelica for how far she’s come for a turnaround transformation, from being a ruthless rival to a long-term loyal ally of his. Too bad that romantic ships be damned, because Rick is loyal to Reanette and Angelica has little to no chance of ever hoping to win his heart.

When you think of quality studios, Yumeta Company is not one of those studios with a big money bag-sized budget, and it really shows for an action-heavy show of this calibre, which proves that 3rd-rate studios truly suffer at key moments in the shows themselves. The majority are pretty bad, but under the right hands, can truly deliver a solid experience, and by the skin of the studio’s teeth, this show does it all and more to sway opinions that an average, generic, run-of-the-mill fantasy show can run on its own two legs when it needs to. Honestly, this is one of the shows that surprised me late into its run of the fact that storytelling trounces animation, and thinking back, I honestly don’t mind it at all if the production values just look so pedestrian, so that the story can flex a lot more.

The music…is definitely one of sheer bizarreness. For one, veteran Anisong singer Akira Kushida (yes, it’s the classic Tokusatsu and 90s Kinnikuman music artist) has a vocal range that is pretty much rarely heard of in anime these days, and through his old-school feel of the OP song, it definitely takes some getting used to before it becomes the earworm that you just can’t skip the opening for all its worth. I know I absolutely did, and slowly grew to love it as one of my low-key favourite OPs of the season. And as for Chiai Fujikawa’s ED…it’s alright and nothing special.

I can already see that this show will divide fans being of a certain age group, more than just the OP power fantasy trash of a trope that this anime is. But more than just what it obviously presents on the plate, it’s the hidden meanings and virtues of the anime that teach the one very important lesson that we ought to understand: “You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.” – C.S. Lewis

I’m glad this show exists to teach us a fair few humble learning points, especially to the Millennials hitting the Big 3 and still feeling like they’re feeling lost and not being sure of what to do with their life. This is, as I've mentioned, unironically the best Ossan-centred anime to date, and life is never too late nor too soon to experience new things, and I’ll leave you with this quote:

Don't think too hard about it and just watch - It's good. The main cast is great, and while the pacing dies a little towards the end, at no point the anime gets egregiously bad in any aspect, which is more than what can be said about the most of them. Solid and easy 8, I'd watch S2 if it came out. This is the proof you don't need to be original or do something special, you just need to do things thatwere done before right."

It started off as a decent but fairly stereotypical fantasy show. It had it's moments early on but it wasn't anything too special. However the final 4 episodes were so well done. The fight scenes, dialogue, and storytelling were so amazing that i have to give this show a 10. Genuinely some of the best fight scene's I've seen in an anime in a long time were in those 4 episodes. I really hope they make a season 2."
54913,538146.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I really liked this anime. I looked forward to it every week. The characters were easy to like and it was engaging. That said, it was also predictable in places and never quite did more than expected of it, but that was not necessarily a bad thing. I had a good time and I didn't get bored. In some ways the lack of uniqueness was surprising to me considering the premise is unique in itself since the main character is in his 30's instead of late teens/early 20's. I was kind of hoping the story would try to break new ground in other ways toobut it kept things simple and I can respect that. 

If you're looking for something that is fast to watch and hits all the marks you'd expect from it, then you'll enjoy this anime. If you're looking for something that wants to be more than its genre and tropes, then you might want to try something else."
54913,539083.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"A fairly generic OP protag comedy fantasy, this one starts off kind of iffy for the first six episodes but gets WAY better in the second half. We've got Rick, our MC, who is in his early 30s and just getting started as an adventurer. At first, he thinks he's got a long way to go to catch up to all these veteran adventurers around him who started much younger than him, but soon he realizes that due to his intense training, he's already got the power of an S-Rank adventurer despite just starting out. Cool, we get the OP thing and a few obliviousprotag jokes too, but the oblivious thing doesn't outlast its welcome and we also get an underlying ""it's never too late to follow your dreams"" message, which is nice to see. Then it turns out Rick has a cheat power (it seems like it only activates when all is lost, so I call the power Deus Ex Machina), which undercuts that message a little bit, but it's a little thing and for the most part the show stays on message.

However, in the first arc, most of the humor in the story is built around the audience accepting the idea that ""30 = old"". If you're north of 30 yourself, it doesn't take long until that ""joke"" gets both tired and insulting. Thankfully, after the third or fourth episode those ""jokes"" pretty much disappear; from that point, most of the humor comes from Rick's supporting cast of S-Ranked adventurers who are 5 times more overpowered than him, and none of them seem to understand the concept of ""restraint"". When Rick's senpais take center stage and start messing stuff up, you get comedic gold. For the second half of the series, the whole ""30 = old"" joke gets (mostly) tossed out the window along with a lot of the more awkward wild swings for laughs, and the story as a whole starts to focus more on the overarching plot, developing the characters as more than just walking punchlines, and maximizing the laughs from the ridiculous OP'edness of Rick and his comrades. For much of the second half, the comedy takes a backseat to the plot, but the series seems to find its groove and becomes significantly more enjoyable.

Ultimately, there's nothing revolutionary going on here: it's mining the same comedy vein that many other have before, and they're not coming up with anything spectacular, but it's good, clean, mindless fun and if you're just looking for something to put a grin on your face, you can do a lot worse."
54913,538152.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"""Ossan Newbie Adventurer"" is good, but really had the possibility to be so much more than what it came out to be. Let me explain what wasn't as good, then I will go onto what is likeable: 1. Forcing good characters to be somewhat bland due to mediocre backstories: The characters are good, but their backstories are a bit flat. Rick, for example, just wants to get stronger to be an adventurer—nothing we haven’t seen before. He kind of gives off One Punch Man vibes but without the humor or depth. Reanette is there mostly to support Rick, and while Broughston gets some backstory in the last episode,he's still just a tank character. Alicerette and Mizett are barely even part of the story. Don’t get me wrong, I like the characters, but they really could’ve been fleshed out better.

2. Not a lot of actual character growth:
This kind of ties into #1. Rick is a powerhouse from the start, and not much changes for him. Reanette has been into him from day one, and Broughston is smart and strong but doesn’t develop much until the last episode. Funny enough, Angelica, a side character, gets more growth than the main cast with development as both as a person and a fighter.

3. Predictable:
With Rick being so strong, you kind of know how most fights are going to go. There's not much suspense when the hero’s practically unbeatable.

4. Mediocre Pacing:
The pacing is a bit all over the place. Sometimes it feels like they drag things out, and other times, they rush through important plot points. It’s not terrible, but definitely could’ve been smoother.

Onto what is enjoyable:
1. Likable characters:
Despite the backstory and growth issues, the characters are still pretty charming. They have unique personalities that aren't just recycled tropes, which is nice.

2. Great fight scenes:
The action scenes are where this show really shines. They’re exciting and well-animated, especially the final battle. If you’re into good fight choreography, this won’t disappoint.

3. Not too much forced romance:
I appreciated that the romance between Reanette and Rick didn’t feel forced. It’s subtle and doesn’t take over the plot, which is a relief since so many fantasy shows push romance too hard or overload on fan service. This one felt natural and balanced.

Overall, ""Ossan Newbie Adventurer"" is an enjoyable watch for those seeking a fun anime to watch. It has its flaws, but the charm and engaging fight scenes make it worth recommending.

54913,538155.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Action-adventure anime featuring a man over 30 appears to be one of the most popular genres in the anime scene at the moment, and I have watched four already in the last 12 months. If ""Former NBA player Brian Scalabrine is closer to LeBron James than the street ballers are to him,"" then ""Ossan Newbie Adventurer"" is closer to the quality of ""Kaiju No. 8"" than the mediocrity of ""I 'Parry' Everything"" and ""A Playthrough of a Certain Dude's VRMMO Life."" Here are some of the pros and cons of this anime.  (+) Music & OP When Muse Asia began teasing the anime's trailer, the soundtrack by TomotakaOosumi piqued my interest, particularly the fighting music. Meanwhile, the OP track evokes a mixed response. Well, I'm certainly on that 'love' side. Well done to Akira Kushida for creating a memorable song for this hidden gem.

(+) Character Design:
Without a doubt, the design of most of these characters makes them incredibly memorable, despite their similarities to other popular anime characters. Rick Gladiator, Reanette, and Kelvin Urwolf would be my Top 3 picks at the moment.

(+) Episode 10-12:
Yes, I understand they are also basically copy-paste of one of your Big 3 Shounen Anime (read: Naruto during the 1v1 at the Chunin Exam), but who cares? The animations exceeded my expectations, and it was evident that Yumeta Company put a lot of effort into the final three episodes.

(+) Funnier than most of the actual comedy anime this season:
As said above, the jokes worked rather well for me, unlike some of the supposed comedy anime this season.

(-) One-hit kill:
Unfortunately, I wasn't a huge fan of those 'one-hit kills', though I understand Orichalcum Fist is literally an S-tier party. I believe the studio could've at least revamped the fighting scenes.

Overall, ""Ossan Newbie Adventurer"" is a fun and intriguing action-adventure anime to watch in your free time."
54913,538771.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"No need for a lenghty review. This was fun to watch. A little bit of old school, in a good sense. Themes, music, all fit this old school feeling. Animation is mostly very nicely done, nothing out of the ordinary but it didn't seem rushed nor cheap in any parts. Maybe one or two shots where detail was not important, yet I couldn't really tell if there were any. Story is fine, I hope it continues. There was not a single character I didn't like, heck, even the suppossed villians are relatable. I wish this will be picked up and continued for at least 1-2 seasons more. I want to see themreach the end of their journey."

It's about an older guy (for an adventurer) who has a dream and gives his all to achieve it. Of course it has the cliché part of the OP MC, buuuut stil really good showing how he developed his power. There are some good side characters, but the development isn't anything groundbreaking, not a stunning design or anything, but still really interesting . If you're looking for something funny yet somehow inspiring, go ahead and give this one a try!"
54913,538816.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"This was my personal sleeper hit of the season. I can imagine it won’t appeal to everyone, but I imagine this will scratch the itch for us old school Shonen people that grew up on this sort of thing. Sure it modernizes it well too, but it has a great core of that old school battle Shonen type feel. It reminded me of being a kid watching Dragon Ball, and watching people just fight to become the strongest in the world. It also does the seemingly new found trope of the older than usual protagonist storyline and how it is never too late to becomewho you want to be.

The action is well done. It won’t do anything you haven’t seen before, but the look just nails the nostalgic feel. Character designs are all pretty cool, and the faces look distinct and interesting. 

The best part to me is the overall plot. It has a good mixture of comedy, adventure, and even a fun tournament arc. It really has everything that I could have wanted as a kid, and it was a nice blast to the past this season."
54913,538488.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Shinmai Ossan Boukensha was a breath of fresh air in a gloomy summer season of anime. Is it going to blow your mind? No. Is it watchable episode 1 through 12? Yes. It's simple, but flashy art style is nice, with a very 90's/2000s vibe that I'm here for. Animation 8/10 - Solid all around, at times its incredible. Sound 8/10 - Best OP of the season, with really good VA work from Angelica, the comedic spots were great. Story 4/10 - The story is not all there, we get the main picture, with speckles of lore throughout, but this main arc isa tournament arc for a glowy ball essentially, which is an important item needed to take on ""Kaiser"", who is a very abstract villain atm.
Characters 7/10
-  Very likeable characters, with good comedic value, and some growth, but lacking depth mostly.
Enjoyment 9/10
-  This season, so far, this is the only anime I looked forward to.  Mind you, I haven't delved into Oshi no Ko S2 or Monogatari, but still, this season of anime is unquestionably bleak, and Shinmai Ossan Boukensha was a bright spot.

This is just fun.  Recommend to everyone, since summer 2024 was so bad."
54913,540704.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"TL:DR Art: 8/10 (design-wise isnt impressive but the details on hair and muscles show the love that was put into the art) Animation: 8/10 (i was expecting that horrendous 3d and moving jpeg-like animation but it was actually GOOD? what the hell??!) Story: 9/10 (The reason is stated below, i can only sum to ''there's beauty in simple things'') Do i reccomend it?: YOU SHOULD WATCH IT YOURSELF, NOW Anyway, here's the essay.I'm not good at writing reviews but i felt the need to say something about this anime anyway.

Here i was binge watching some anime from the season that i left to pile up and then i came across this gem. Its so underrated that i had a hard time trying to understand how it didin't got some of the spotlight of the season. 

This anime is about an almost middle aged man that had abandoned his dream of turning into a great adventurer just like the one from legend  because of family matters and expectations piled upon him, forcing him to pursue a life that had a value on its own right but wasn't close to what his heart desired, making him get stuck between pursuing his dream or living an unfulfilling life. 

Some of Rick's struggles are pretty relatable, where people often tells him that its too late to become an adventurer or even have a proper progress since debutting as an adventurer at ''old'' age imples that your potential to succeed in life is almost inexistent but despite that rick got the will and drive to improve himself that most of people doesn't have or  didn't experienced before or forgot about.

I just can't put into words about how this anime suprised me, i was just thinking of it as a mid fantasy with overpowered but somewhat not boring/inssuferable mc and i was punched in the face like the rest of the cast lol, i was in a tough phase of my life and had almost the same issues as rick with his family and people near him, losing hope on the future because i wasted  my ''prime''  and that caused me to lose interest in everything and put the bare minimum of effort on things just to keep living (i'm 28 as of now, and im pretty sure when i hit the late 30's i will laugh while reading this). This anime was a godsend and something that i really needed to watch, not just because of rick but every main and side character felt so interesting in its own ways that i had a good time. I felt as i was being told something like ''f*ck what people say, do what you love regardless of your age, its never too late to restart on life and pursue your passion, don't lose your drive, when you start to make your steps on chasing your own happiness then people that really care about you will come into your life when you less expect''."
54913,538728.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Ossan Newbie is a simple anime that can be a lot of fun if you let it in. It reminds me a lot of Solo Leveling and even Kaiju No. 8 as far as feeling and weight goes, but obviously, Ossan Newbie is a lot more lighthearted and easygoing. It might even come off a little One Punch man-ish, but that that comparison is loose, in my opinion. Regardless, Ossan Newbie is a fun anime that's one of the highlights of 2024 for me. Each episode is quick and easy to watch and doesn't ask very much of the view. The plot is not complicatedto follow at all, so that's a huge plus. The character development can only go so far, but the action, the way it brings our small group of characters together, and how fun the fights are all come together to make for a fun summer anime. 

The art style isn't terrible, but it's also not spectacular. It's easy to overlook this when you're having fun watching what could possibly be a classic anime. It's simple, but it has a hefty punch, and it doesn't require too much effort from the viewer."
54913,538183.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"This anime connected too much with my Ossan side. it started with that nice story and ended with a little love in the heart, an anime that I didn't expect much and in my opinion, it was one of the best of the season (man seriously, I love those super masculine Hokuto no Ken and Toriko shonen-adventure vibes this show). The whistle ver of the ED and the last line for Rick that basically tells it's never too late to learn was a nice send off for the season. Freaking loved this anime, I'll read the manga as soon as I can (2nd SEASON DOKO???)."
54913,540438.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"As an aside: I cannot believe this was adapted from a manga. I was so confident in my misconception that this was originally a novel because the JP webnovel ""Ossan Boukensha no Jimichi na Isekai Tabi"" which is a COMPLETELY different story than this show, ""Shinmai Ossan Boukensha, Saikyou Party ni Shinu hodo Kitaerarete Muteki ni Naru,"" have such similar names. Yes I don't actually know that much Japanese, so I just thought that it'd be impossible for there to be two different series with ""Ossan Boukensha"" as the main title. So when I went and looked at the adaptation material, color me surprised whenit was actually a manga.

Anyways, that's probably the most interesting thing in this review. What can I say? I feel a bit embarrassed to even review this show. It's so straightforward the synopsis can basically describe everything you need to know about the show. It's simple and straightforward; exceedingly so. 

The main character is one that goes from someone that's an office worker, never learned how to fight in a world of swords and magic, and trained like hell for a few years and became super strong. He and his party go on a macguffin quest to summon and fight the dragon of legends, Kaiser Alsapiet. 

The main appeal is learning about the party members and their dynamics. Everyone in Orichalcum Fist is insanely strong, and so there isn't a lot of life and death situations that the party encounters. It's more about the people they meet, experiences, and battles that they fight through their quest to summon Kaiser Alsapiet.

There are obvious themes of training and perseverance will never let you down, and a pretty straightforward romance that's quite average. The other party members are also fun to learn about. Alicerette and Mizette are especially fun to listen to with their voice acting, Alicerette's child-like personality shining through and Mizette's....Osaka dialect? Hell if I know. Of course, there's Broughtston, whose character development and personality are swimmingly well. I can't say I have much to complain about any of the characters, although Reanette is obviously just the love interest, but even she is fine I suppose.

There's definite fan-service, but it's not so excessive but definitely present to the point where it's glaringly obvious. But I'll let it pass since that too is such a hallmark of a generic action fantasy show, is it not?

The battles similarly feature a decent magic and strength system in a world of swords and magic. It's got the whole package of an action-fantasy, with comedy and slice of life also dominating a decent chunk of screen time. Overall, you'll instantly be able to tell if you like the show from episode 1.

Despite how I say everything is predictable and average, what can I say, there's a soft spot for this type of genre for me. So, 7/10. Fight me."
54913,538419.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"The anime has an exciting storyline, but it lacks any real depth or suspense. The first four episodes are so annoying that I was on the verge of dropping the anime. Rick our MC is dripping with self-doubt, even though he should know better than anyone what powers he has. To make matters worse, he was also bullied. This nonsense culminated in the ridiculously high requirements for admission to the Adventure. It felt like a final exam for the S-Class was being held here and not a test of suitability for the adventure. From episode 5 onwards, the storyline became more stable and the anime even becamereally interesting. However, there is one thing that always annoys me. If you can only train mana at a young age and mana is a necessity to become an adventurer, why didn't Rick do it? It doesn't make sense, especially if he was told about the potential of a skill at a young age."
54913,539247.0,4.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"This is a pretty good series with a pretty good premise, in my opinion. I love the power fantasy vibe in any kind of medium and this one has that and more. What I do not enjoy, also in any medium, is a steadfast reliance on flashbacks. If I'm supposed to know something, weave it into the narrative and don't cut away from things just to be like ""oh by the way, here are ten minutes of explanation about this particular thing, which may or may not be vital to your enjoyment."" For a super light spoiler, there's a sequence about why the party was formed.It occupies six minutes and twenty-two seconds to begin the final episode, and by that point I could not care any less. With eleven episodes behind me, I understand the characters enough for me to enjoy watching two buff dudes beat the shit out of each other. I don't need to know, and if I did actually really super need to know, those six-point-five minutes should have been put in the first one or two episodes.

That happens in every single episode, by the way. I didn't time anything, but it feels to me as if thirty percent of the whole series was flashbacks, always at inopportune times, and about things that don't really matter. I don't require a lore dump because I'm semi-intelligent and sentient, and have the ability to infer information without being spoonfed. And like I said, if the writers/producers/directors felt this was imperative data for viewers to possess, put all of it at the beginning.

Also and finally, it seriously put me off that this is a tournament anime. Nothing in the description implied that we'd spend the first three episodes in a magical qualifying tournament, followed by one episode that is completely a flashback, one decent episode about adventuring, then all the rest about the other tournament. All, of course, littered with flashbacks.

For positives, as I said I really enjoy the premise, and going with that I suppose is the execution; this is clearly a high budget affair and there are no crappy 3D animations or still-image panning shots, and the voice acting plus music is top tier. Comedy is also a big factor, and it all was well done and the jokes hit. However, I cannot recommend this unless your tolerance for flashbacks and tournaments is extremely high. Otherwise it will be tedious and feel like a chore to watch.

PS. Naturally barely any of the main plot is addressed, the premise is basically ignored, and there nothing satisfactory happens in that regard. This is a demo for the book only."

It is an anime with an interesting premise, but the low budget in animation takes away too much from it, taking into account that after the management of territories, thisis the second most important thing, but the story although it has already been seen is interesting, since they do not show the main character as all-powerful, the story is somewhat interesting, but the animation makes it heavy to watch"
57876,537578.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I liked this show for the following: - Medieval fantasy setting - No characters seem truly OP yet, all have a weakness and go through trouble - MC has an interesting backstory - Large-scale battles, tactics, kingdoms - Human/demon interactions are interesting - MC has a secret identity I disliked this show for the following: - Harem-like aspects (to be fair one is a pig-demon-man, though)- Ending was weak... I actually didn't realize what I watched last week was in fact the final episode 12 of the season
- Fairly predictable plot from episode to episode
- MC teleporting around so often, it sacrifices the journey/adventure of traveling in this world, all to increase the pacing of events
- MC's secret identity turns out to be not-so-secret as time goes on
- Some of the animation is bad at times, like for the mobs
- MC has not been put through enough of an ordeal yet, never really felt worried for him personally, but his troops/army/etc sure

If 5/10 means 50% like and 50% dislike, this is 7/10. I like the setting a lot, I have gripes about some characters, but overall I enjoyed it.

Lately it seems people are systematically review-nuking anything involving fantasy... I get that there is just too much, but you should always watch the first episode of a show if you think it seems interesting... and decide for yourself. Don't rely on the rating number or what other people think. If someone truly hates a show, they would drop it and not finish it! To finish a show means, by definition, that person found the show watchable, or they don't value their own time. The only consideration after that is whether or not you enjoyed it. It is very much NOT fashionable right now to admit enjoying fantasy or isekai."
57876,537289.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Weak storyline, the plot is boring. I can't understand why some reviewers talk about ""rebirth in another world"". I didn't even notice a scene like that. The episodes are action-packed but most of the scenes don't make sense. Like episode 8, for example. The hole in the wall is patched up with a spell, only to then open a new hole in a different place during a counterattack. Military and strategic decisions are absolute nonsense. On second glance, they probably tried to add a ""harem touch"" but apparently didn't quite follow through with this idea. I really wonder where all these animes without a meaningful story come from.It's truly amazing that they even take the time to animate something like that."
57876,536786.0,3.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"The Strongest Magician in the Demon Lord's Army Was a Human - A demon-parading human wants to be like Tensei Slime's Rimuru to bring demons and humans together? That's quite the ambitious approach that's a long way to realisation. Ask just anyone around if fantasy, like Isekai, has gotten stale no matter how many AniManga works we've received, especially over recent years with a copy-paste rhetoric that has a premise that, despite being generic, is ""unique"" to the point of creating a story for it. And that's exactly what we get with novelist Ryousuke Hata's Maougun Saikyou no Majutsushi wa Ningen datta a.k.a The Strongest Magicianin the Demon Lord's Army Was a Human, whose premise/plot you should be able to capture the nuance by its very descriptive title alone.

""Kids, I'm about to tell you a bedtime story, about how a human can disguise his way to becoming part of demons. The TL;DR - just be a person strong in any attribute that's worthy of supporting the race you're fighting for and have a goal in mind to accomplish what you want to be in the organization.""

Like seriously, the aforementioned human that is simply called Ike, he may be a human whom, in the uncommon case of a kind demon taking after to adopt and teach him magic skills, to which he's grown and now supported by a fellow demon sorceress, he's just someone being built different for his course of events: be a leading figure in the Demon army, hide his secret as much as possible even if the few will by chance know of his humanly demeanour, and keep the status quo pretty much for as long as he shall. But being a human, Ike has ambitions, like bringing both the human and demon race together to co-exist as one entity together, but this ambition is beset by the ""needless"" war between both races to determine who's superior, because demons are that egoistical to begin with. Alas, that's just really all that Ike's going for, because he seeks harmony with no matrimony for the surroundings, just being a plain average Joe who fights for the sake of the matter. He's a Lawful Good and Evil on that regard.

The supporting cast are just as hilarious in their own terms. The demon head honcho that is Dairokuten, exudes demonic and Chaotic Evil, but she comes off as being a Lawful or Neutral Evil due to her teenager-like stance that all she's just good for is being a spokesperson so that she can command Ike on what to do in her regard. Quite a lazy leader, if you ask me. Except for the maid Satie for whom she comes off as a Chaotic Good, the others are just a total misfire, just as is the setting and world-building, which are egregiously missing. But then again, this is a rather simple story plot, so the goal is pretty much what you see going with the 3-episode rule set in mind for this show, which is about the perfect ""just one more episode"" duration you could give to experience all that it is, because it's barebones as heck and hell to then and back.

Basically put, this is a show that has no care given to it, that screams of the people behind this just wanting to finish and be done with so they can wash their hands off of a failing project and move onto the next. Given Studio A-CAT's standards, expect nothing but the worst in both 2D and especially the studio's ""signature"" 3DCG production (which is actually worse than last season's Highspeed Etoile in all regards), and the music, despite being composed by famed composer Kohta Yamamoto, his talent is wasted and washed dry from the ashes of this anime, from the OST, and even right down to the OP and ED itself sounding like inferior versions of Attack on Titan's OST, if made demonic to begin with.

Like some others, I always say: there is good within the bad, but this show proved that assumption completely wrong, because there's just nothing redeemable about this anime, nor even its original source work, which was goodness-graciously not overstretched by the imagination of its estranged author thinking that he could be ""inspired"" to write as much as possible out of complete genericness for a retarded execution.

Sorry to break your bones, but this anime is just barely watchable. Skip this show, you're really not missing much."

We learn about he’s background how he became a 'demon'. Not only that this anime is an isekai so our Ike is i, Reincarnated from earth to fantasy world. Its not the most important part of the storyand actually its not get mention a lot expect some moments when Ike uses ideas or instruments from our world.

So why I dont like it? This anime is mostly about Tactics Ike plans and uses and most of them is not working. Most of them are stupid or very basic for an anime that rely on them. Mostly we see Ike in battles for cities and how he attacks or protects them. Its actually a good idea to make an anime about it and it can be interesting. But its must done wrong.Most of his plans work because of the plot and not because they are good. Not only that story sometimes gets away from the main theme and we have stupid episodes that we don’t even need.

About characters its actually 50/50 for me. The cast is not bad but not enough to make this anime decent. Ike is not the worst MC. He has he’s good moments and he is pretty smart. Understand how he needs to act and good at magic. But in the same time he is not that interesting he is just there. In the other hand Cefiro and the demon lord are pretty interesting characters but we dont see them too much. Cefiro is Ike’s mentor a very powerful demon and commander. Sadly we didn’t see her enough, same with Demon Lord, interesting character but they didn’t shown her personality to us. The last people Im gonna talk about is comedic characters which are Satie, Lilith and Jiron. Expect of Lilith we dont need them for story but they are pretty enjoyable. Satie is mostly needed to shown human side of Ike that he cannot shown to others. And its kind of enjoyable to watch three of them fight for Ike’s attention.

Basically not the worst cast for an fantasy anime. But I think the humans can be done better. In the end demons fights with humans and that side was pretty boring so the battles did lack at character expect too.

Animation was bad. I dont like overuse of 3D and I dont like it its just annoying to me.


Overall, its an bad to mediocre fantasy/isekai. Not enough powerful moments to call it good. Its lack tactics and interesting battles, more interesting MC and better world building"

- lots of boring scenes that made me sped up to 1.25x

As a crappy Isekai anime watcher, I'm still intrigued for a 2nd season if existing since they haven't dug up enough Ike's story before death and Romberg. However, this needs a slight studio upgrade. 

Overall, this anime is recommended only for anime fans with low standards."

you'd be better off watching code geass, or OVERLORD, as those two anime literally have the same plot, with more interesting twists and turns, powers at work, animation quality, relationships, etc. 

my advice? skip this one unless you have nothing better to do or just watch episodes 1-5; nothing different or noteworthy happens from that point on."

If you like the first episode and opening, I guess you'll like the rest, because in my eyes they make clear with how bad it is. Content: fairly interesting military tactics, war and nation totality picture, et cetera. In shows different strategies utilized and elements that go past the battle/war to have a successful society. Style: abysmal for most part, but technically, I think this is okay. Characters: very lame though the MC, the Demon Lord, and one enemy commander, are somewhat interesting, at least to listen to Side Characters:mostly cookie cutter CGI mess, but doesn't rally matter I guess

The Studio is rotten, the best work that this horrible Studio has ever done, has a 6.76 rating, terrible, a Studio so old and managing not to have a hit or a good animation in over 20 years should be a shame for the industry. ﻿ ﻿However, even with a good animation it wouldn't fill the void of a work without characteristics that remindyou of him (in the sense that, like really good animes, you can remember some striking characteristic, like character personality, design, story, plot, animation, or things like that), something that this anime is far from having.﻿
﻿I found the plot cool in a way, with a promise of a cool story, I saw that the anime tended to be a Tensei Shitara Slime, in the sense that the protagonist doesn't get too involved in fighting but rather his army and he stays more with the administrative part, taking care of his land, making treaties with other countries/kingdoms and the like, I found it interesting, but Tensei Shitara Slime (I'll use this as an example even though the work here is not an isekai), has its characteristics which are the ogres with good designs and Rimuru himself being an underestimated slime and it's impactful, besides other little things... I liked the presence of some characters like the beautiful (and hot LOL) mage Cefiro, and the presence of his maid who is pretty standard for the anime genre, in fact if she had a better design and animation both would be remarkable.﻿
﻿I didn't think the anime was bad at all, I liked some things, I found it interesting, like how he's very intelligent in how he commands the army and doesn't let them down and doesn't come up with a solution to the problem on his own, we're shown him solving the problems and that's good, the episodes were well adapted, I haven't read the original work, but I didn't see any episode that was too convoluted or too rushed, nor was the forced marriage as a treaty with the other kingdom done there, so as not to be simply thrown aside without a complete resolution. ﻿
﻿I don't think having a second season of the anime will do any good for the name of the work, honestly it's better for the author to try to adapt another one, because even if there's better animation in the next season or a better story in the future, it's hard for anyone to want to watch this first season. ﻿
﻿That's it, I don't recommend it."
57876,539052.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"My thoughts are complicated on this one The premise is good, I actually liked that it didn't take itself too seriously with the inclusion of the pig and succubus characters giving a comic relief (even if I'm in the minority on that) The story itself is fine. For me, I have issues with a lot of the execution, it thinks it is smarter than it is, Ike is supposed to be a genius tactician yet it is hard to see that being the case. also the use of weapons and siege tactics is often totally wrong. For a series that is a medieval fantasy and features a lotof medieval warfare, it lacks even a surface level understanding of the subject matter

It felt like the series tried to do too much, tried to be too many things, it needed to focus in more on just a few elements and then it might have been a better series, as it is, it just ended up average.

Simply put, there are better series out there."
57876,537191.0,5.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"This anime is a clear example of how a great opportunity for innovation in the genre can be wasted—not by revolutionizing it, but by settling into such a state of creative laziness that it ends up being boring. The plot is overly simplistic and basic, and the supporting characters are more like puppets, unfortunately in a negative sense. They're used as mere props for the protagonist, with shallow, caricature-like traits that rely on repetitive and tired stereotypes. The battles are almost nonexistent, with only a few rare exceptions. They unfold in one of two ways: either you're bored watching the protagonist lift a staff, or you're subjectedto awkwardly animated monsters that move clumsily, though at least they follow some kind of logic.

One of the few strengths of this work, however, is the protagonist's intelligence and cunning in battle, which is highlighted through comparisons with other generals, both demonic and human. His intellect makes him far more interesting as a character than his embarrassingly underwhelming combat style, marred by poorly depicted and awkwardly executed magic.

In conclusion, while the protagonist's strategic mind offers some redeeming qualities, the anime falls flat due to weak storytelling, bland supporting characters, and uninspired battle sequences. It ultimately squanders what could have been a compelling narrative."
57876,537218.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"This anime is a fine example of ""so bad that it's good"" while not being too much of a bother to watch. The title gives away exactly what kind of anime this is. Cheap, generic copy paste isekai, that portrays demons as the ""good side"" you'd want to root for. A pleasant surprise was how nuanced it manages to be, especially in contrast to how the storytelling can be rather blunt and rough at times. There's no time wasted with filler content, it is straight to the point and most interactions have plot relevance aside from the very obvious comedic moments. The pig is whinyand annoying, but not overly so. He can be taken seriously and has an actual useful role, being the main character's tactical right hand.
The girls are all designed overly ""sexy"", clearly an effort to appeal to fanservice enjoyers. You won't find any nudity or erotic scenes though, and the main character luckily isn't a pervert type, so its not a big deal. 

This show is by no means a masterpiece, and the storytelling is rather lazy and silly. However, if you're looking to scratch that specific itch for a low-budget generic Isekai in a pro-demon setting, you might just enjoy it like I did."
57876,536996.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"After having finished this anime, I feel pretty safe in repeating what my preliminary review said: it's fine. Everything is fine. Nothing is great. Nothing is particularly bad. It's... fine. That is simultaneously the best and worst thing I can say about this anime: it's fine. The show manages to do everything that it sets out to do, which is basically to ""not completely suck"" and it manages to do that. However, when not being terrible is the height of your ambition, it's also the best you can hope to accomplish. So this show... doesn't suck; which is not praise. It is forgettable mediocrity: something topass some time and then forget everything about it in less time than it takes you to click on a different show to watch.

The show's title tells you all you need to know about the concept. When you start watching it, you get this vague feeling like you've seen this all before, and now it's all being delivered to you in the most-slightly-better-than-bad version possible; if you told me that an AI wrote this anime, I'd believe you. Everything feels like it's going down a checklist of what you expect to see: the harem that the protag doesn't realize is developing around him; the superior who passes all their work onto him; the overconfident, mustache-twirling villains; the inexplicably ever-increasing number of people who know the secret; and of course the OP protag. 

I could spend a section writing about what is good and what's bad, but it doesn't really matter: the good stuff is merely satisfactory, and the bad stuff is pretty forgivable. Everything is just fine: no more, and no less. 

So, it's fine. You can do worse if you're just looking for some media content to fill the air. But you can also do better."

Dunno who came up with that idea, the director, writer or author but it totally wrecks the mc's strategical characteristics. Using a gun ain't exactly what you call a 'strategy' in a medieval fantasy world. The story falls flat, was expecting some 'Overlord' vibes but got letdown. And why introduce a useless teleportation if they end up trekking for four days on foot? It's painful to watch.

56062,538743.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Why Does Nobody Remember Me in This World? - Oh Dear Good God, Kei Sazane. Finally, you have a story of your very own, but why does it have to look like dogshit when compared to your other works, which, despite having a tad better production, are absolute mediocrities overall? Man, what a shame. Sorry, forgive me for that rant. If you've been in the AniManga scene since the COVID era, you might've caught a glance at one particular show called Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou, Aruiwa Sekai ga Hajimaru Seisen a.k.a Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World (or shortenedto KimiSen). Written by novelist Kei Sazane, the anime came out in Fall 2020, that tells of a Romeo and Juilet-inspired story in a fantasy world. Needless to say, I was one of a handful of people who hated the show outright for it trying to be ""innovative"" in its concept, but rehashing the author's tried-and-true tropes of just about every cliche known to man, so much so that the entire anime was an absolute cringefest to sit through the seasonal worth of its 12 episodes.

Come this year of 2024, and Kei Sazane is raking in more fame and (mostly bad) recognition, because this copy-paste imitation of an author has 3 of his most recent works under his belt being made into anime: the continuation of KimiSen into Season 2, last season's No Game, No Life ripoff (or more similarly of last Summer's Liar, Liar) of Kami wa Game ni Ueteiru. a.k.a Gods' Games We Play, and the work that out of the 3, that I REALLY wanted all the more to succeed: Naze Boku no Sekai wo Daremo Oboeteinai no ka? a.k.a Why Does Nobody Remember Me in This World?, the most ""original"" work that Kei Sazane has ever done, even if it's by no means innovative in the fantasy genre. You've gotta hand it to this man, at least he tried something different for his own ""unique flavour"" that stands out in his copy-paste biography of works over the last decade or so, and I'm relieved that for once, by his own standards, Kei Sazane got that formula right out of the gate.

What started out as your typical war between humans and other entities of races you can only find in fantasy novels and the like, suddenly gets shifted into a time paradigm where the war that's won by the humans and led by its titular hero character, is overwritten to the point that humans never existed in the alternate world. This is the plot device of MC Kai Sakura-Vento, a soldier of the existing Urza Federation who enjoyed the prosperity after humanity's hero of the Prophet Sid did the deed to render humanity as winners of the Great War of the Five Races, alongside his comrades of Ashran Highroll, Saki Miscotti, and his childhood friend of Jeanne E. Anis, whom he fought alongside the war, with whom the latter of the 3 he's bonded quite a lot to be potential future partners. The suddenness to have his world be mysteriously distorted in no time to assimilate, forcibly leaving the comfort of Jeanne and the new world and encountering another world where humans are not at the top nor bottom, but non-existing in the Great War, he is the only one who's sane (or insane, depending on the worldview) who has an inkling of Prophet Sid, and as the title goes: no one truly remembers who Kai is in the alternate world. It's up to him to find out what tracks this perverse course of action that renders the people he knows into complete strangers, and what exactly does his alternate world have in store for him retracing the Great War of the Five Races once again, only this time with some help that could get the alternate world back on track with the events of his world.

Being the only one who remembers all that is within his old world, Kai slowly is aware of the events that he is part of, never truly got off the ground in the alternate world that knows no inkling of neither him nor the Prophet Sid at all. It's only when he meets the mysterious demon of Rinne, all chained up at what seems to be Heaven, as well as the sword that was imbued to him: Code Holder (that once belonged to Prophet Sid), Kai begins to slowly piece the sequence of events of humanity's speckle in a world where demons have truly taken over its timeline. And out of all the characters, even in the list of many ""couple"" MCs that Kei Sazane has put out so far, Kai and Rinne are the most passive when compared to KimiSen's Iska and Aliceliese, as well as Kami wa Game's Fay Theo Philus and Leoleshea. What's up with creating characters so backwards that you need extra characters to help progress him and her forward, This is not how you want to paint your central characters, especially for a world that's this elaborate, intricate, and, IMO, a decent sci-fi and power fantasy action series that has content to stand on its own heft. Most of the time, it feels like Kai and Rinne were forced into the alternate world just to make amends for the right course of action, as they meet characters from other races and align the correct vision against all odds, no matter how fearsome their opponents are. And one of them is Last Riser: the entity of anomaly who reacts to Sid's sword whenever it's used, that is akin to a moderator when things of Kai's world (such as Sid's name) are registered as taboo words that should not be said, and anyone who utters even just a minute of the word gets forcibly erased from the world, adding another layer into an already complex war that Kai, Jeanne and the others have to go through the same-old once again.

To be clear, the story itself is fine and serviceable (and actually worth a second look), but Kai and Rinne have a lot of ways to go and gain ground if they truly want to stand out, and so far within the anime that's part of the already completed LN that ended back in August 2020, they've just been stuck like players who need to be fed quests to progress their plot forward. As I've said, it's truly a missed opportunity to have characters just be there to service its plot and not do more on their behalf, which unfortunately is the result of Kei Sazane himself prioritizing the wrong things for the right stuff. If anything, characters can make up for the lack of story, but not the other way around, and this show unfortunately is the sum of many errors that could make a potential difference.

Oof, woe is Project No. 9 having an enigma of a Summer season adapting 2 shows in the same season, but the same 2 shows that have a very noticeable difference when compared against one another. While Senpai wa Otokonoko a.k.a Senpai Is an Otokonoko had Aniplex's backing, which allowed the anime to be marginally expressive to the point of being impressive thanks to the conglomerate's big budget, it's the complete opposite for this show where the coined ""low-budget"" term really comes into play. From the mediocre visuals to the horrible animation, it feels as if I have to second guess if I'm watching the exact same show of low expectations when it comes to production values to begin with. For sure, this is one of the worst produced shows of the season, and it's quite the jarring expose to watch a show so drab and dysfunctional.

The year 2024 also brings all Kei Sazane works the affiliation with musical project Sizuk and J-Pop ""hybride rock band"" AliA, and if you're the type to like modern rock music, look no further than KimiSen's sequel season and Kami wa Game for that. But their music is just not to my tastes, and they're replaced by symphonic power metal band Unlucky Morpheus, whose OP song while being a fit to the show's themes, sounds average overall, but I'd argue that I'll take any song that's n Sizuk nor AliA any day.

It truly pains me to say that Naze Boku no Sekai wo Daremo Oboeteinai no ka? a.k.a Why Does Nobody Remember Me in This World?, while being the best work that Kei Sazane has ever done in recent years, the manga adaptation of the LN is a much better alternative to what the anime has shown us for the past 3 months. And as someone who legitimately trashes the author for his copy-paste tactics, he may have gotten a rare case of a W in the story section, everything else is just a massive L for something that could've been a success, if only he'd cared with the rest to give it the proper treatment that it truly deserves.

If you excuse me, I shall go and read the manga adaptation instead and let the anime adaptation be just a blip that came and went with an unpleasant taste to my eyes. Only watch this if you have the sanity to suffer through all 12 episodes of unabated subpar animation."
56062,538800.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"I feel like this was just one of the shows that existed this season. It never made a strong impact either way. Neither negative or positive feelings. It was no, it was there, and I wasn’t having a bad time. That’s about all I can really say about it, in all honesty. The story was strange. A multi-species war breaks out, and the humans won. Oh wait, our mostly soulless protag gets taken to another world where it’s the same people, but the outcome of the war changes, and only he remembers what happened in the other world. Obviously the story gets a bit more advancedthan that eventually, but that’s the general idea. The problem is the story never really feels like it matters much. It just kinda checks the boxes and keeps moving never really stopping to let it all sink in. Cute girl, onto the next battle. Introduce characters just enough to make you not completely disinterested, and then onto the next action scene. 

As far as safe seasonal shows go, this really wasn’t al too bad. I just can’t really recommend it fully as for everything this does I think other shows do better. In fact Our Last Crusade… the author’s other offering I feel like is much better and it unfortunately got delayed."
56062,538768.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"The third of Sazane Kei’s to get an anime is actually the best in my opinion. Nazeboku had a really cool alternate timeline gimmick, mystery, characters and atmosphere that just hooked me from the start. What it lacks in animation quality it made up for in narrative and was really an entertaining watch. It’s not the best fantasy story in the world, but you know it has that “it” factor that I just liked and wanted more week after week. Admittedly very sad to see this one end with all the questions I still have about the world! Imagine you’re going about your daily life asusual and all of a sudden the world completely changes and no one remembers you despite all the same people you remember being around. Scary right? That’s basically the set up of this series and Kai’s journey to solve the mystery of “world reincarnation”.  It was something I hadn’t seen before in an anime so in a sea of other fantasy shows it stood out a bit. Yea, Kai is OP, but he’s got limited allies and knowledge in this world so the whole appeal is seeing him reconnect with people he knew from the past timeline, explain to them the situation and enlist their help in saving the world. Humans who were originally the dominant species in his last world are now being hunted to near extinction with small pockets of humanity still fighting back against the various factions who want them dead. It had a bit of terminator salvation going on and I loved that. I’m a sucker for humanity on its last legs fighting back against near insurmountable odds and seeing Kai turn the tide of the war with his knowledge was cool.

The characters are the highlight though. I think this had one of the more underrated casts this season. Jeanne, Reiren, Rinne etc were all powerful and competent and just made for a really fun travelling party dynamic. I love the classic fantasy trope of setting off on a long journey together and this show nailed that. It does start to get a little harem-y at the end, but it wasn’t like most seasonal anime so if you’re someone who’s grown a little tired of every girl falling in love with the MC, you’re mainly in the clear here. I also think the ones who do like the MC have a genuine reason for it, it’s not just because he was nice to them or something. Lot of fun banter between everyone, the jokes landed for me and they really did feel like a family. The one thing I didn’t like in terms of the cast is just how some fights with them were handled. Like Kai has a weapon that’s supposed to be a god tier relic and is strong as hell, yet he will leave Jeanne on her own to fight with a weapon that drains her life? This happened on a couple occasions and I was genuinely perplexed. Like I get wanting your female characters to be bad ass, but man don’t leave them to die like that.

The only knocks against this show for me are the subpar production values and the fact it ended with me still having so many questions! This was a good fantasy story and I’m really dying to know more about the world reincarnation mystery. Seems like third time’s the charm for Sazane sensei, he really did a good job here.

Nazeboku gets 8 out of 10."
56062,539395.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Really surprised how many 'not recommended' reviews this has. Apparently, the low score is also due to those who know the source material and not liking the anime. Is the animation absolutely amazing? No it isn't. But is it the worst? By no stretch of the imagination. There are much worse battles in anime that have higher ratings than this. Listen, it's low budget, but it isn't that bad. Some of the fights are even better than your usual trash isekai budget fights, which is what this should be compared to. The MLC and FLC are pretty bland, I'll give it that. But there are at leasta couple decent characters in there.

But the strength in this anime imo is in the world building. The premise of the story seems kinda meh, but actually watching the plot play out is actually pretty interesting even if things seem to wrap up too neatly. Problem when trying to fit too much into one season.

TLDR: If this had a bigger budget, people probably wouldn't rag on this as much as they do. The world building and story is decent and worth a watch."
56062,540164.0,6.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"This anime had the potential to become great, but as an anime only, I can say that it is just disappointing. We were left out of a lot of explanations. The budget constraints are clearly visible and at the same time, we can see that it was pretty much rushed. One moment, a lot of people are there and the other, only a few are there. Small things along with the rushed plot ruined this. Towards the end, fights, which normally should last 2–3 episodes, last about 10 minutes or even less than that. Animation: 6/10 It could've been a lot better than what we got.There's nothing extraordinary about this.

Art: 8/10
I liked the character designs.

Sound: 8/10
The ending song and a few soundtracks were to my liking.

Story: 6/10
As I wrote earlier, if it were well paced and properly written, we would have got a great story. Instead, we got a rushed series with very little and delayed explanations for whatever was explained.

Overall, it was fine at best to watch as a weekly show. If you missed this show while it was airing, I don't think it is worth watching. There are tons of other anime which are better. The concept used in the show is something that is not used many times, at least in the way it was portrayed in this show, but it did not do well."
56062,538770.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"A story where you are the only one remembering the true version of the world, is it hard to deal with the sudden struggles that humanity suddenly has, after losing the war they originally had won. In this show do we follow Kai, a soldier that for some reason is the only one that isn’t overwritten when the rest of the world is. We then follow him struggle his way through a world where humanity has lost and now tries to save what he can. The only issue is how it all is executed. When it comes to the plot, it seems to be fairly interesting, whereit builds up around someone who’s greatest weapon is their knowledge of the true timeline. We also see plots where other characters get to shine and are introduced, which gives a more balanced view of the main characters. But the show is very much built around the fantasy and action genres, which is clearly shown, but sadly it falls flat due to the animation of the show.

When it comes to the characters, do they have some interesting ideas for character development, where some of the personal plots they go through, can show some progression for both side and main characters. What holds back the characters from being actually great is once again the animation of the show.

Now to get to the root of why I cannot recommend this show, the animation. The general problem in the animation can be surmised to, high amount of still images, little attention to details and slow movement overall. This brings down the plot, the characters and the action part of the show. With all of this is it hard to get invested with the plot and the characters since their conversations doesn’t seem like an animated show but like a slideshow with moving mouths. Also when it comes to the action part it is just not interesting when each strike is done with still images and little attention to the details in their movements, while dwelling too long on each strike in the fight.

Overall would i not recommend the anime, it is just poorly executed and just ruins what could have been a good story. So if you like the concept, would i recommend reading the source material."
56062,539982.0,5.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Disclosure: I am an absolute sucker for trash seasonal anime. This show, however, wasn’t that in any capacityz it’s not trash. It’s not horrible per se. It, however, wasn’t profound or insightful in any aspects. It was just there- it was mediocre. It wasn’t mediocre because of the plot. It was mediocre because of the horrible execution and incoherence of why and how things occurred. While the show was overall fine and had many good aspects of it, its nosedive in quality regarding both graphics/animation as well as plot coherency made it leave a really bitter taste in my mouth. While the plot seems logical forthe first couple episodes surrounding the show (the reoccurrence of a multi race war among fantasy races after the original hero which unified them all had their history overwritten), the events towards the end of the season were rushed and made little to no sense surrounding both why and how they occurred. Riddled with plot holes, poor pacing, and an incoherent course of events, the show was lackluster. It had potential to be a decent anime of the summer season, nonetheless, its many issues have rendered it quit forgettable. I’m honestly kind of disappointed having wasted time watching it because of how uneventful the show felt in the last episode.

I would NOT recommend watching this show if you haven’t seen it already. I’d also wager that your enjoyment of the show will diminish as the episodes go by. It, however, isn’t necessarily a “bad” anime. I’ve seen so many worse which put a fraction of the time, money, and effort into it’s development. I, however, firmly believe that this show isn’t worth viewing for the average weeb on here, especially if you have decent expectations going in. I had no such expectations, nonetheless, I was disappointed with the ending and how the show developed for the worse as it progressed.

These are just my two cents. Take it for what it is."

The story really hooked me right from the first episode. I can be pretty picky about what I watch, especially since I’m not a fan of overly comedic shows. I lean more towards the dramatic side, which is why I think Attack on Titan is the best anime out there. Sure, I can appreciate some humor when it fits, but a lot of anime just feels too light and lacks real tension. ""Naze Boku no Sekai"" hits all the rightnotes for me—its animation is top-notch, and I find myself connecting with the characters because they always seem so determined. Plus, the fan service is done well; it shows some skin without crossing into ecchi territory. The action scenes are also impressive, featuring sweeping shots and grand set pieces. This is one of the most underrated anime I've seen, and I'm glad I gave it a shot."

The problem with this series was the very very poor animation quality I don’t know how they did this, the characters faces looks like nothing is happening in any moment, animation for the fight was the worst I’ve ever seen in a long time, direction of the chapter could be better with the dialog or the expressions, etc. For summary if the studios had put effort into itthis serios could be at least a 7.0 not a 6.something. A shame because I read the LN at is good is, not the big thing but is entertaining, the series with all his faults is entertaining for me, so with effort It would have been very good.

Not sure how anyone could recommend it, though sure, a great anime to waist your time while being brain rotted to the maximum.

57810,537081.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Shoshimin is one of several pleasant surprises I got this season. As someone who hasn’t seen Hyouka(crazy, I know), I wasn’t familiar with the author’s writing style or how his series are structured so I went into this blind and from episode 1 I was immediately hooked. Despite it being an extremely dialogue heavy story and slow paced detective style story, these episodes went by in the blink of an eye and were consistently engaging. It was almost like we were playing a game alongside the two leads in terms of solving the cases and more often than not I found myself thoroughly surprised bythe twists the author includes. This is a must watch for any mystery fan or if you just want a new cute waifu, because Osanai was definitely one of the best this season.

After watching the first episode I kept thinking to myself how similar this felt to another detective mystery series from recently that I loved, undead girl murder farce. The character interactions, the way mundane episodes passed by in a blink because of the direction.. and wouldn’t you know it, it’s the same studio. Loved every single minute of this one. Whether it’s a kidnapping or found out who ate a desert(yes that’s a real case, in fact multiple), there’s not a dull moment in this series. The cases are actually very interesting and it’s easy to get lost in them trying to figure out who the culprit is or how something happened. What’s more is that they are genuinely surprising. Just like Undead Girl, this show has a tendency of throwing you for a loop and misdirecting you before coming up with a twist at the end. Often times the answer is right in front of you, but the way the author reveals it is so satisfying.  

In addition to the mystery cases, the other big draw here is the relationship between Kobato and Osanai. They have such a fun and muted dynamic. The characters talk relatively realistically, their banter is fun and I love seeing Kobato get roped into Osanai’s absurd desert eating schemes or just missions around town. They’re truly a blast to watch. There’s definitely romantic undertones between them, but the show doesn’t go too far in that direction. You can feel that they like each other but they’re not swooning after one another like your average high school anime. I think this being a novel series rather than a light novel series adds a degree of maturity and depth to the story that light novels frankly tend to lack. It feels like it was aimed at a more mature audience who don’t need everything spelled out for them or fanservice to keep their attention and I love that. To bring another comparison to undead girl murder farce, undead girl is also a novel and had a lot of those same themes, so I’m starting to just see that as a connection among novel adaptations as opposed to light novels which are marketed towards young adults.

I think Shoshimin is one of the best shows of the season and I’ve been high on it since episode 1, even including it in my new anime to watch for Summer video. Two months later and it’s not fallen in my standings. Brilliant show with a great cast of characters, some cool mystery cases and a grounded storytelling and directorial method. Very good watch that I can’t recommend enough! Here’s to hoping the author sits down and writes some more.

Shoshimin gets 9, out of 10."
57810,537311.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"If shoshimin has no haters, I'm dead. Shoshimin is genuinely one of the most boring anime I have ever watched. Gsarthotegga's review said it best; this show is an absolute nothing burger. Kobato and Osanai are cardboard cutouts who talk as if they have some crazy, wild, dynamic backstory between the two of them making them change their life and become ordinary. So much of this show is them talking about nothing like it's the most high stakes adventure of their lives after they decided in middle school to change for the better when in reality they're solving mysteries like, ""how was the hot cocoa made?""and ""who ate the spicy candy?"" It feels like I'm watching paint dry and every minute is excruciating. When we do see glimpses of their supposedly crazy lifestyles, it's the most normal interaction between middle schoolers ever. And don't even get me started on the lame twist of episode 9 and how nothing actually changes because of it.

At least the technical aspects are slightly better. I could tell there was signigicant effort put into how the series was portrayed visually. As much as possible is done to make up for the complete lack of anything happening. The second worst element of this series however, is the aspect ratio. For seemingly no reason other than to feign being cinematic and save money, the choice was made to letterbox every episode. Half of the screen is taken up by giant black bars which adds nothing. Only in the opening is anything creative done with it, and even then it's the bare minimum.

Shoshimin isn't bad per se, but it commits the crime of being so boring it hurts. I can't believe it was approved for a second season. The only reason I completed it is because it was 10 episodes, but I should have just dropped it. I don't recommend it to anybody. Don't waste your time.

3.6/10"
57810,537093.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"This show was a good-to-fine experience. It’s actually at its most enjoyable during its early stages where we know little about these characters and are just exploring minor mysteries through their inquisitive lenses. Visually, it’s also excellent, doing a great job portraying how the characters are thinking through these mysteries and jumping between settings. It definitely sets itself apart in that regard. The story eventually had to include things like character development and a continuous plot, which are both just fine. I don’t think we explored either of the leads enough to invest me in their stories - their backgrounds are largely given as hints andboth characters are too stoic to sell meaningful moments in the present - and the larger plots of the story just didn’t land for me. Osanai’s plot feels both largely warranted and needlessly convoluted to the point that it roped in basically everyone, so you can understand why she did it and also be kinda mad that she had to bring so many others into her scheme without telling them. Kobato just feels like he’s playing detective most of the time, though his unnecessary rescue of Osanai at least gave him a moment to shine. I found Dojima more interesting than either of them, both in his character and his aims.

I’d say the biggest problem with this series is the lack of focus on the title. Why do they want to become ordinary? Osanai seems to desire to do so to step away from a dangerous past, which would be better if we got more peeks into her history. We get more insight into Kobato, but his whole thing seems to just be a desire not to stand out, which isn’t a strong motivation. I think the story would have been facilitated by giving us an idea of how they met and came to decide that ordinary was what they wanted to be. Why does Kobato care about how others see him when it seems like he’s driven by curiosity? Osanai seems like she only wants to become unusual in a different way, so why ordinary? Maybe the point is that they’re just running away from other problems and found common cause with another person in the same pursuit, coming to an accord with them to pursue something that was always beyond their reach but finding something more valuable in the process. Maybe that’s just me reading too deeply into something that’s never fully explicated or explored.

Overall, while I can’t say this had many high highs, it also didn’t have low points, it was just pretty good for much of its run with an opportunity to get better as it explores these characters in distinct contexts with other people. I think the point at which it left us could lead to interesting future episodes, so I’ll stick around for S2, even though I feel somewhat mixed on this season."
57810,537090.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Pretty sleepy. Lots of sitting and talking and eating. Slow for a 10-episode series. The episodic mysteries are low-stakes. Looks pretty good for a novel adaptation, even for one sold by a pretty-girl character. The animation is not as innovative as Hyouka and without the studio brand name, but it is much more consistent in tone with the story and subject matter. The biggest mysteries are the characters, and the main characters in particular. Why Jogoro and Osanai want to be ""Shoushimin""/Petit Bourgeousie/Civilians is only implied or teased for almost the entire season. Rather than main character Jogoro or even deuteragonist Osanai being the only one ortwo genius detective characters with a clue about what's going on, the cast is much more broadly competent, which opens up the possibilities for the story and solutions, and the story is more fun to follow along with even in the drier episodes.

Yonezawa's writing has a way of lulling the audience to sleep, and then surprising with a gentle twist ending that colors the characters and relationships from the rising action. The most satisfying part of his writing is that the twist usually leans *into* what is more realistic or practical for the setting than *away* from it. The ep 10 falling-action ""twist"" away from genre convention and toward development of the main characters is one of the best examples of this I've ever seen. I would even count the nature of the rising-action mystery in the final arc as a ""twist"" given the mood of most of the stories up to that point.

If you're bored to tears after ep 1, you could skip ahead to 6, but this is probably not worth your time. If you're still interested at all after you realize what you're getting into end of the painful ""Hot Chocolate Mystery"" ep 2, this season will probably reward your attention more than you would expect."
57810,537078.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Shoshimin: How to Become Ordinary is quite a curious title. With it being a mystery anime, even just its title leads me to question things. “Shoshimin”, is translated as the ""petite bourgeoisie"", which refers to someone in the lower middle class. So indeed, that might be what constitutes an “ordinary person” in a financial sense. Who or what is trying to be ordinary though? The characters? The whole plot itself? A likely reason why you (and myself) might be interested in this series is that it was written by the same author, Honobu Yonezawa, who wrote another mystery series in Hyouka. I can definitely see thesimilarities in these two series, with both tackling mysteries that are grounded in the sense of ordinary, mundane life. Shoshimin takes it one step further though, and in my opinion, brings it to an even more “ordinary” sense, with little mysteries in daily life that seem even trivial to most people. For most of this season, the show revolved around simple daily tasks, like buying sweets, solving a mystery of who ate the missing sweet, things that we might take for granted through our lives, but through all these experiences, they coalesce into a larger mystery, which is one of the things I appreciated most about this series.

A big mystery, is why Jougorou’s agreement with Yuki, which was to be “ordinary” together, exists. Why do these two want to be ordinary, and stay out of people’s lives? What were their pasts like? Bit by bit, by watching the two main characters and their lives, and how such twisted individuals have such trouble with being ordinary, one being drawn to being a detective, and the other having sharp insight and the ability to act quickly, we get to know just a tiny bit about the characters. Though, we have to ask, what does “being ordinary” actually mean? Does it mean that you go with the flow like everyone else, or act like everyone else does? Jougorou’s definition of being ordinary seems to revolve around not butting in to other people’s problems, or in other words, keeping the status quo, but by trying so hard to keep that status quo, it seems more deviant than ordinary, in trying to quell every one of life’s swells.

The biggest issue that people might find with this show is that there’s no real hook. It’s more of a “feeling-out process” then something with an immediate pay-off. Through its overall gorgeous visuals, it can hook you into the most “boring” and mundane of mysteries, or entrap you in its depiction of delicious sweets that have you frothing at the mouth. If you’re not into that, then this show is not for you, but the show certainly invites you to try it out, with its initial slow pacing. It’s easy to feel that it’s average or boring, but I think that is what the show is going for, because in showcasing what it means to be ordinary, the show must feel like that as well. In that sense, I think the show did that extremely well.

As a second season is indeed on the way, I say, we let them keep cooking. If the food looked that good, whoever was in the kitchen knew what they were doing, that’s for sure. Overall, the show did its job well in allowing the viewer to find intrigue and beauty in the mundane. It slows down to the pace of an iyashikei sometimes, yet swells up with tension ever so slightly to keep you interested. It’s not an approach to a show I have seen much at all, and that’s all the more reason why I ended up enjoying it as much as I did. The only thing that I’m questioning is the direction that the story is going in, and what the main point of the show is, but since there is still more to adapt, there’s time to rectify that issue.

With so many questions left unanswered, one can only say, “I’m curious!”"
57810,537079.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Shoshimin: How to Become Ordinary - What does it take to teach someone about being ordinary, when the people or things around us are unordinary to begin with? Mystery shows...I'm betting that all you can think of is just ""no shit Sherlock"" Holmes, and to be fair, putting all media together seems to do the one-trick pony that the genre itself is nothing without the classic titular character. However, in the AniManga space, that trend has been progressing since the turn of the millennium (especially the mid-2010s), and it all has to do with one word: Hyouka. Yes, you heard me right: one of KyoAni's masterpieceshows that got unleashed all the way back in 2012, based off of the Koten-bu a.k.a Classic Literature Club series of novels written by famed novelist Honobu Yonezawa, was both a tour de force of the original source materal, made elevated by KyoAni's anime which is both well-produced and still respected to this very day.

So why did I mention Honobu Yonezawa and his famed series, other than the fact that I have not gotten around to watching the 22-episode anime, in such high regard? Because 12 years later, we get yet another anime based off of a brand new novel of his series: Shoshimin - How to Become Ordinary, continuing the dessert trend by adapting the first 2 volumes of the novels (Spring Limited-Edition Strawberry Tart &amp; Summer Limited-Edition Tropical Parfait) whilst giving it a more in-depth look at the human society in general...a case study on Marxism for the specifics.

To explain all about the Shoushimin series, is to expand on its literal meaning: The term, translated to Small Citizen or Petite/Petty (meaning small) bourgeoisie, refers to a social class composed of semi-autonomous peasants and small-scale merchants. They are named as such because their political economic ideological stance in times of stability is reflective of the proper haute bourgeoisie (high bourgeoisie or upper class), who regularly seek to identify themselves with said group, whose bourgeois morality, conduct, and lifestyle they aspire to and strive to imitate. The term, going as far back as the Revolutionary period in France (if not earlier), is politico-economic and addresses historical materialism, in what was once originally denoted a sub-stratum of the middle classes in the 18th and early-19th centuries of western Europe, until German economist Karl Marx and other Marxist theorists used the term petite bourgeoisie to academically identify the socio-economic stratum of the bourgeoisie that consists of small shopkeepers and self-employed artisans in the mid-19th century.

Putting the above context back into the series, Shoshimin stars the dumb-downed versions of the mystery ""power couple"" Hotaro Oreki and Eru Chitanda, as both Jogoro Kobaro and Yuki Osanai wander around their school with only one question in mind: what does it take for one to become ordinary? Such a simple question like that, bogs the both of them into a spiral of the ""Series of Unforuntate Events,"" solving mysteries that are also pretty much dumb-downed versions of Hyouka, but still compelling cases to boot, even if they start off being dessert-like with its sweetness, to only then come feeding off the back of the mouths' palates with the savoury sourness coming from the complexity of the cases as a result. Because you see, the human race is made up of many social classes hidden to the naked eye...it really depends on where that crowd is to define who're the peasants and the merchants.

Going deeper into characterization, and the entire Shoshimin hidden meaning makes more sense. Yes, Yuki Osanai is not Eru Chitanda, but you can't discount that her petite and innocent nature hides a mysterious facade that's hard to crack, much like trying to be the haute bourgeoisie, which is the average Joe. The mysteries she deals with are twofold: she first outlines the different layers of the cake with the know-how of the case at hand, as simple as starting from missing desserts being eaten to create one fine case, to a plot to rid of an old enemy with deep, intricate levels of complexity as fine as possible, then goes to the different icings where every layer bonds each other, adding weight towards the overall analyses where each plot pointer leads to the exquisite composition of the case at hand, and every question has an answer to finish the intricate garnish to be presented as one fine heft of a cake. Yuki's smart, but also cunning to a scary degree with her monotonous personality.

Shifting the plate onto the guy in question, Jogoro Kobato has clearly the brains of a developed Hotaro Oreki (after Chitanda trains him enough), and he's every bit of the haute bourgeoisie that she wants to imitate and achieve, aside from his analytical mind to solve the cases alongside Yuki. Together with his good friend Kengo Dojima, Kobato is kind-natured, but also does his own deep analyses, trying to cover each and every corner, thus not leaving any stone unturned. As much as he's always accompanying Yuki and her various dessert antics, Kobato may come off as an expressionless person being the Watson alongside his Sherlock Holmes of the opposite sex, but the constant barrage of desserts just keeps him in focus that the cases, while not sweet but sour, are defintely a test of his abilities in question of what it means to be ordinary, and by the grace of the sweet girl, his sourness gets coats of sugar, and the genuine friendship circles around the two in delicious harmony, even if they have differences at times. Dojima, on the other hand, is already at the haute bourgeoisie level, but he too feels like a pinch of salt getting kneaded under both Yuki and Kobato's hands, his strength and conviction only sully him when he's needed the most.

Even in the mundane moments, studio Lapin Track goes the extra mile to make the show look cinematic, almost as if you’re watching a feature work that was intended to be made that way. Thanks to the input from the rather small studio, as well as the massive blunder of The Promised Neverland's adaptation with veteran director Mamoru Kanbe (even though The Promised Neverland was a one-off massive blunder) and series composer Toshiya Ono (though he only did Season 1, which was a far better job), this show is more than just a treat for the eyes from start to finish with the cinematic 21:9 movie aspect used proper to showcase both sweet and savoury dishes on small, clean platters.

Even the OST itself is kind of unique in its execution, where the minimalistic approach is key as the recipes of the cases are followed step-by-step throughout the methodical approach. One thing's for sure, you're not going to hear a lot of BGM in this one because ""silence is golden."" Eve's OP and ammo's ED are just as juxtaposed in their use, not just between animation and reality, but of beauty as well, alongside rather fine songs that are just OK.

It's easy to get into the Shoushimin Series thinking that the nuances will be similar to those of Hyouka (especially for those who watched the anime or read the novels before), but I'd argue that that mindset actually does you more harm than good to set high expectations whilst experiencing something out of the ordinary, even if going by the dumbed-down case complexities that the former is now known for (if you've watched the show all the way through and made it this far to the review). Regardless, given its relatively smaller cast and the ""easy"" difficulty setting of the cases (which can feel boring at times, but it's not), I can still assure you that no matter how small the package, Honobu Yonezawa STILL manages to find a way to deliver stacked delicious desserts, delicate as they come, stock full with different layers of cake and icing that makes the Sherlock Holmes-esque cases, worth the run to be consumed and savoured.

Whatever it is, the Shoshimin Series is worth giving a try, even though it will never come close to the much superior and influential cult-classic series that is Hyouka."

I understand some watchers might not be interested I daresay bored even. This anime is best for watchers who like thinking, and calm style type anime (aka kinda like slice of life). Overall loved it. Btw the voice actors are so good, sometimes I feel like they are so natural at this the whispering and the calm tone are super amazing, it’s as if they are actually talking if you know what I mean.

So, I came into the Shoushimin Series not knowing what to expect, and I'm happy with how it turned out. In short, Shoushimin Series is a show about ""ordinary people"" spending their days trying to do ordinary things while solving the small mysteries in everyday life. While it may not be a thrill ride from start to finish, it offers something gentle and charming in its own way. The Shoushimin Series excels in balancing light detective elements with slice-of-life moments. I personally found this perfect to watch when winding down aftera long day or right before going to sleep. The mysteries may be small, but they add a nice layer of intrigue without being too intense. Heck, they had a full 10-minute breakdown of how a guy makes his hot chocolate. And they somehow managed to keep it engaging the whole way through.

The art style and animation are visually beautiful, and the character designs and settings are perfect. As I previously stated, I haven't watched Hyouka, but I've heard that the art in Hyouka was also one of its strong points, and the Shoushimin Series follows this. One thing that stood out to me was the random changes of settings mid-conversation, which seemed to happen often. While I don't know if there was any deeper meaning behind it, it made the scenes more dynamic and fun to watch.

Another highlight is the opening and ending themes. The stunning music and visuals complement the show's overall tone. I especially love how they blended anime characters with real-life scenes and backgrounds in the ending theme. 

The series' final episodes shift from lighthearted mystery-solving to a more dramatic twist. This moment adds an unexpected layer of emotional complexity to the story, transforming it from a simple slice-of-life mystery to something with more weight.

The final episode of the Shoushimin Series left me with mixed feelings. Introducing two specific new characters left me a bit conflicted, although it was probably necessary for the main characters to develop. Although I am not entirely sold on this shift in tone, it definitely has me looking forward to season two, where I hope to see how these new dynamics unfold.

Overall, Shoushimin Series is a solid show that knows what it wants to do and does it well. While nothing blew me away or had me super hooked throughout the show, excluding the final episodes, it's an enjoyable watch that offers a nice mix of mystery, slice-of-life, and light drama. I can't justify giving it more than a 7/10 for these reasons, but I recommend it if you're looking for something relaxing yet engaging with a bit of unexpected drama."

To your average watcher, the transitions that are depicted are to only flaunt the studios' art prowess. These notions are what you might be under the impression of if you are only perceiving this story on a surface level. Shoushimin delves deeper into the genre of mystery and interpersonal relationships more so than you might believe. The slow pacing and anti-climatic atmosphere of this show are what makes this anime so ordinary and so extraordinary at the same time. Emotions aren't dramatized and its characters are not one dimensional.There is something different about this anime and if it is going where I think it's going, we are in for a hell of a ride. I just hope that it doesn't become your typical will they won't they, slice of life kind of story as we have seen with a majority of school detective anime like Hyouka. Not degrading Hyouka in any way. I believe the author's intention for it was to appeal to a wider audience with its visuals and lovable characters whilst Shoushimin takes a twist to a Hyouka narrative."
57810,538230.0,8.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"The Pursuit of Normalcy: Shoshimin’s Unique Blend of Mystery and Slice of Life It’s about a sweets obsessed girl and a seemingly ordinary boy, who happens to become friends with each other to help each other break their habits of revenge and deduction respectively and become a “Shoshimin.” It is 60% mystery, 25% sweets and 15% Shoshimin, aka being normal people. (Which is actually one of the definitions in the dictionary) It is this Shoshimin part that throws some people off as they are perplexed by the pair’s strenuous efforts to become normal. In contrast, I was initially taken in by the story purely because of myown experience being in a Japanese high school. It resonated with me at a time when I was trying to fit in with Japanese people. The my reason, similar to the main characters, being that there are disadvantages to being seen as different. After a few episodes, I was sold on the “Shoshimin,” concept. The occasional remarks Kobato makes on how a “Shoshimin” should act were very relatable to what I observed from Japanese people on a daily basis. As the season progressed, I felt less pressure to be “normal,” thus my fever with the Shoshimin identity went down. Nevertheless, I think the anime offers interesting takes on what is and what is not normal for Japanese people.

So as farcical as it might seem for some people for two high school students to be so obsessed with being “normal,” it felt right in my heart and it might in yours too. 
Besides, the character design and the animation is world class. Kobato and Osanai’s chemistry is just perfect. The sweets are drawn so well and the way the characters eat them, makes me want to go to a patisserie every time. It starts off slow but the mystery solving gets better with each episode; even though I am not an avid follower of mystery anime, it was very enjoyable. The openings and the endings are amazing as well. The colour palette of the opening animation is just beautiful and I enjoyed the ending where they showed pictures from the town Gifu that the anime was based. 
Overall, Shoshimin is a brilliant mystery, slice of life anime that also deals with societal norms.

DO WATCH: If you like mystery, a bit of sweets and find the struggle to become normal relatable
DON’T WATCH: If you feel that Osanai and Kobato’s efforts to become normal is obnoxious or looking for a bit of romance. (The Shoshimin theme continues throughout the whole season!)"

It's basically a series of mysteries that focus on small unimportant issues (or non-issues) and treats them like the usual murder case that we always see in the genre. Fortunately this anime can somehow turn those unimportant issues just as intetesting as those previously mentioned murders. Not only is that done because of the impeccably written dialogue, but also some of the BEST directorial work I have seen in sometime, this show looks like a movie . The production here is absolute 5 stars: animation, direction, music, cinematography, editing, no notes. The character work Shosimin presents issubtle, grounded and very realistic. The characters dont scream or have over-the-top expressions. And while that's fine with most anime I think ditching that characteristic of the medium does absolute wonders for this show.

This feels especially frustrating considering how low stakes most of the mysteries are, and while I loved the dynamic between the main charactersI can’t say I was too invested at any point as on the whole it felt rather directionless until it hits a fairly abrupt ending with a rather poor cliffhanger.

On the whole it’s a solid show and if you like detective type mystery shows there’s definitely a lot to enjoy here, it’s just unfortunately let down by inconsistent quality throughout and a questionable central narrative."
57810,537173.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"This show is great for fans that just wants to be taken to a ride. The plot is rather unique, in a sense that for a show set in high school, it doesn't include student council. It's a slow-paced show, with low stakes, relatively few conflicts, and is cute and beautiful most times. Most of the times while watching I would pause the show just to admire the art style. The set pieces are great, and the scoring is very on point. The show also has interesting characters, subverting tropes and the subtle nuances of their characters leak every episode. 10/10 would recommend"
57810,537202.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"So the idea was becoming ordinary, but did they even try? :D Osanai and Kobato are two highschool students that want to become ordinary due to an event that happened in their past. These two really like to solve mysteries, especially together. But this aspect of them actually made harm for theirselves or others many times in their past so they want to get rid of it. Mysteries they solve are pretty hard to accomplish to be honest. I've seen some other people that really want them to be couple (including myself), but I think, mysteries were more interesting than that. There's always events happeningand they pretty much everytime try to solve it so there's no time to be thinking that...

Next, drawings and colouring. I found the drawing style pretty unique especially the eyes. The drawings were desprate and the colouring was really relaxing, this contrast is pretty hard to accomplish..

I want to add a paragraph to explain something different because it really caught my attention. When these to start to thinking, like weighing their opinions, getting the pieces together, we see a separate universe at the background. These backgrounds had no people in it, filled with silence or natural sounds  so there was nothing to distract from thinking them. I suppose, this might be a symbolism. Because these two had a habit of solving mysteries since they were at middle school so they're used to thinking. These backgrounds may symbolise their minds. They think together and they don't get distracted from anything which means emptiness and silence no matter where they are.

Lastly, the characters. I wasn't expecting depth in characters but last episode did include some of their pasts which gave Osanai and Kobato a meaning, they were not shallow.

Overall is 8.4/10. I would really like to give a score higher than 9 but the idea is not that peculiar, just solving mysteries so this is what i gave instead. I think some people might think the anime is monotone, but I enjoyed it."
57810,537286.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Just like Hyouka, another work by the same author, the work has a calmer vibe and is about mysteries. However, I would say that the characters have less personality and the work is less bright, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, because I really liked it, especially Osanai, who is very cute. Good animation, I got several beautiful wallpapers with Osanai, the animation fit very well with the vibe of the anime. A good story, I felt a little lack of development and a bit of making us attach to the characters, even though they are kind of ""emotionless"" it would still be possible for somethinglike that, but that's okay.

In general, it's a good work, the scenes where they discuss things go beyond the environment they are in, the way they explain not only the problems but also their solutions is also good, in general it's very enjoyable to watch.

Now about the ending, STAY AWAY FROM OSANAI"
57810,538026.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I really came in blind with this one, the title being the reason I decided to watch the first episode till the tenth and final one for this season before the second. I had the impression that it was going to be about two students living a sort of ""normal"" slice of life fays and hanging out with friends and engaging with new ones. I was half-right. What I got were two more than ordinary students trying to be ordinary making simple days in an episode engaging, engaging being using your brain to try and figure it all out during a few or more episodes,and curious for what the next episode or two will be about.

For an episode about one plot to an arc that may take two, three, or more episodes, I believe the anime does it well with managing them within the 25 min runtimes for each of them. The ones where it's just one ""regular"" day to an afternoon for them make it feel short, and that's not a bad thing. You're so into what is happening the episode(s) that time passes fast before you know it. Setting is everyday life as  high school students that becomes something more with the two main characters and others around them driving the story forward in unexpected ways that haven't gotten me invested since Insomniacs After School.

Kobato and Osanai are the main characters of the story, the former being a student with excellent detective skills, the latter being a sweets-loving student with sharp insight and the ability to act, who try and help each other become ""ordinary"" following their own personal incidents that brough them to depend on each other. Their personalities may look neutral for most of the episodes but how they express them makes up for it and makes them one of the many anime characters I can relate to and like. As for supporting, Doujima is the one supporting character you'll immediately grow to enjoy having around. The rest of the supporting cast don't have as much presence as Doujima suiince they appear in at least an 1-3 episodes but that's a given with the focus being on Kobato and Osanai, but I believe that may change with Season 2 after the tenth episode.

Overall, this anime about two students trying to become ordinary is worth a try if you want something to watch outside of the ""normal"" animes you watch."
57810,538265.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Started watching this after I seen some clips of it on Twitter after the first episode aired, the cinematic style of it really caught my eye so I added it to my anime for this season. Can't really say I was disappointed. For the cinematic aspect it definitely continued delivering, lots of really cool and unique shots you wont see in a lot of anime. I could see a lot of people finding this anime to be a boring watch, it comprises of mostly episodic mysteries of small little things, an example for context, how someone made 3 cups of hot chocolate without dirtying anydishes. It all small trivial matters like that but it manages to make it really interesting to watch. The overarching story is not anything crazy but its enough to keep me interested in the characters and their development. I really am hoping this gets a second season because its such a nice change of pace in anime as a whole."
57810,540132.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I don't remember why I added this anime. I wasn't even aware of the anime Hyouka that this anime is often compared to. Yet, its visuals blew me away, and it has become my second favourite anime of Summer 2024 next to Gimai Seikatsu. § Overview Episode 1 starts with Kobato Jougorou and Osanai Yuki meeting for the first day of school. But Kobato's old friend Doujima Kengo invites him to solve a mystery. Afterwards, as they declare that they will become ordinary, they go to a certain shop to buy a rare seasonal cake only for it to be destroyed. And the rest as theysay is the rest of the story. 

The rest of the episodes repeat this pattern of seemingly ordinary and inconsequential mystery until the big reveal that this is not a slice of life as many people are anticipating.


§ Straight from the horse's mouth

I implore you to read my friend http://x.com/ssss_haru19's translations of relevant interviews:

Part 1 - Anime Director Kanbe Mamoru's interview: https://shinseiki.blog/2024/08/29/mamoru-kanbe-interview-on-shoushimin-series/

Part 2 - Scriptwriter Ohno Toshiya's interview: https://shinseiki.blog/2024/09/07/toshiya-ohno-interview-on-shoushimin-series/

Part 3 - Sound Director Obata Takahiro's interview: https://shinseiki.blog/2024/09/21/takahiro-obata-interview-on-shoushimin-series/


Here are the insights you can get from this:

*This anime is primarily about dialogue. The visuals and the background musick are there to support the dialogue. 

*This anime will have minimal use of background musick so that whenever musick is used, especially the main theme ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-vR_Q1ZJKM ), its impact will be greater.

*Director Kanbe specifically asks the voice actors for Osanai and Kobato to speak in whispers as though they are in a library. 

*The extensive use of what I termed 'nondiegetic sceneries' is this anime's signature visual style. 

*The use of flashbacks is avoided. 

Note that there's one instance of flashback in the final episode, but in situations where other anime use flashbacks, this one uses nondiegetic inserts, i.e. these 'flashbacks' are inserted in the same frame as Kobato as though they are witnessing it or perhaps Kobato is seen as re-enacting something so he can understand the sequence of events that will lead to his conclusion.


§ Notes and Remarks


§§ Shoushimin v Hyouka

I hadn't seen Hyouka when I started. The majority prefer Hyouka and only a small minority prefer Shoushimin over Hyouka. I suspect that you will like more what you first watched and love, but a fair, side-by-side comparison would only be valid by taking season 2 of Shoushimin into account because season 1 of Hyouka had 22 episodes while season 1 of Shoushimin had 10 episodes and a season 2 of Shoushimin is at least 10 episodes.

My review thus deals with Shoushimin on its own terms.  


§§ My First Impression of Shoushimin as Something Comparable to Makoto Shinkai Movies

The first thing you would notice is that it seems to be comparable to the visuals in Makoto Shinkai movies, or so I thought. The OP had cinematic aspect ratio and I was surprised that this aspect ratio was continuously used throughout the anime. Also, the ED has mostly live-action shows but puts anime characters and colour graded appropriately so that you would think that it is a hyperrealistic animation rather than live-action shots. 

The way it animated water in a river is great.

These good-looking visuals are not consistent. Background people are often not animated to save some of the animation budget.


§§ The Purpose of Good Cinematography

This is well and good, but having good visuals is not enough as can be seen in The Elusive Samurai. I was bored with The Elusive Samurai, and it is fair that some people are bored with Shoushimin. Good visuals through the use of visual storytelling, i.e. the use of certain framing as well as choices of colour and other visual elements — must complement the main storytelling, which in this case is dialogue. This has been the aim of Director Kanbe, and I think Shoushimin has succeeded.

Sadly, this anime doesn't handhold people. It is too subtle for its own good. If you don't engage with the visual elements and think about what they are subtly communicating, you will definitely be bored.

The dialogue/exposition should be considered together with the visual elements in the overall storytelling. This is not for passive viewers.

This anime motivated me to re-read my books on film because its use of visual elements invites analysis. I offer my notes on the visuals and how they add to the storytelling:

§§ Dialogue-Driven Storytelling

There is action in one sense that characters move from Point A to Point B. They walk and they eat. But there are no fighting scenes. If there is one, they are done offscreen. The main medium of storytelling here is dialogue supplemented by deliberate and careful use of visual elements. 

Even though it's dialogue-driven, the internal monologue has been removed by Director Kanbe to be replaced by the visuals. This is in stark contrast to what the Monogatari series has done with its tell-more-than-show style.

I read somewhere that the novels stated in the prologue why Kobato and Osanai are not ordinary and why they are seeking not to stand out in high school. It's clear from Episode 1 why Kobato is not one; he has the potential to become a master detective like Sherlock Holmes. 

For a good number of episodes, it is not clear why Osanai is not ordinary or what her gift is. I think it's a good decision to withhold this information as the ultimate reveal in Episode 9 was very satisfying. 

From a seemingly mundane, slice of life, this is indeed a good mystery show, and Episode 9 recontextualises everything you know about it. The whole thing is one giant misdirection. 


§§ Sound Design

As mentioned above, it is minimalistic in its use of musickal score as this relies on dialogue. The main theme https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-vR_Q1ZJKM played in the latter part of Episode 1 as they promised to do their best to become ordinary, and this sequence is one of this anime's striking imagery. 

There were variations of the main theme played, and its use ranged from highlighting Kobato's conflict with playing detective as well as something else. 

The full version of the main theme played again in the final episode, but it played to contradict the purpose where this main theme was playing in Episode 1. This is a good parallelism.


§ My Score

I give it a 9/10 and a 'Recommended' rating. I know not everyone will like it, but I am convinced that everyone should give this a chance. It's not like ordinary anime that relies on sexy girls with high-pitched voices. 

Even though I would have loved to, I can't in good conscience give it a 10. There were two fun but filler episodes that somehow made me doubt how great this anime is, but it recovered over the next several episodes. 

For something similar in effect to the reveal in Shoushimin, I recommend Yatagarasu. It doesn't require paying attention to the visuals as you will be engaged with the plot (though it won't hurt). That one has mystery elements and deserves my 10."
57810,537683.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"This anime has some good points and others bad. The bad points are that the promise is very simple and generic... It is a common person, very generic. Another point is the initial eps, that is very slow... The biggest bad point is the plot, that could be better! In general, is as Horimiya, after all, this is of same author. The anime has a good animation, it has personality and others points, but with the problems above, that for me, is considerable, I didn't know if I shall recommend this. The second season seems more interesting, so, I personally will give a chance."
57810,537348.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Much like the two main characters, the experience of watching Shoushimin has been uncanny to say the least. From the direction to the writing, every aspect of the show feels unnatural and strange, as if an alien without an understanding of how humans work but has read countless LNs decided to write and direct an LN of their own. It's weird, but not in a good way. Let me elaborate further. Making hot cocoa in the least amount of steps and a kidnapping should not be treated as dramatic equals, yet the show depicts the two events with equal gravitas with similar inner monologues andstrange inhuman dialogue sequences that feel like it was strung together by two chatbots. Compounding this is how our perspective character, Warm Wat- I mean- Kobato-kun is innately interested even in mundane, who cares-type mysteries (a trait it shares with Hyouka I suppose). Kobato is like if one of those detective books for children came to life and manifested as a high school boy.  He may be interested in these things, but I sure wasn't. I almost dozed off watching this show, and no, I don't care how one of the Berliners should have had mustard in them.

Then there is Osanai. I get the novel's original intent was to portray her as this eccentric psychopath trying to become ordinary, but in the show itself she just comes across as stupid with no sense of self-preservation. If this hadn't taken place in fantasy Gifu where nothing bad really happens, Osanai would've ended up in a ditch before the kidnapping arc. Her one-track obsession with creating mysteries for Kobato to solve comes across as annoying and frustrating rather than endearing, and there is no reason why Kobato should put up with her antics beyond Kobato himself being a lost cause.

But the real issue with the show is how shockingly boring it is. While Lapin Track did a decent job animating Shoushimin, it really does nothing to help its watchability. Some shots do look nice, but the material just doesn't deserve this kind of presentation. The problems with Shoushimin are with its writing and characters, and no amount of letterboxing can fix that.

I don't recommend this show unless you have insomnia, but the hot cocoa episode was kinda funny and pretty emblematic of the show's overall problems. So watch that episode only if you must.

56063,538587.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Nier Automata was once thought to be unadaptable as an anime. “It relies too much on video game mechanics.” “The story is too confusing to work as an anime”they said. Well, A-1 pictures proved everyone wrong. It might have gone through a few delays, but fans of the game and anime-onlies alike will be satisfied with how Nier Automata turned out. They took one of the most complicated and confusing stories in gaming and adapted it perfectly as an anime, even improving on many aspects of the already tremendous story. This was truly a masterclass in the love and attention to detail needed to bringa video game to this medium, and one of the best shows this year hands down.

I was already impressed with the job they did with the first cour, but part 2 blows all of that out of the water. For one, the story of Nier Automata naturally picks up in the second half and secondly, A-1’s direction, pacing and awesome animation helped bring things to a new level. Automata is naturally a game that’s confusing at first since it’s a sequel to Replicant and a spin-off of Drakengard so there’s a lot of concepts thrown at the player or viewer in this case, that aren’t explained until this cour. Those reveals are done so well here, it’s a perfect mix of lore while not overwhelming the casual viewer. While some things are naturally omitted, I felt they more than captured the essence of all the important story beats. There’s also the original stuff they added to the show to connect the dots and flesh the world out, particularly in the case of Lily and the resistance. They were kind of just NPCs in the game, while the anime really brings them to life and makes us emotionally invested. It makes certain events that much more profound and frankly painful. This was really an amazing story choice because it made A2’s story a lot more personal as well. I was already a massive A2 stan, but after watching this I feel like I gained a totally new perspective on her and understand her way of thinking and feelings a lot more than in the game. 

This season sort of acts as a juxtaposition between A2’s ascent back to the light and opening her “heart” up to the world again, and 9s’ gradual descent into darkness and shutting himself off from everyone after some events occur. In the second half, most of the episodes follow this split storytelling method which I really enjoyed because I was able to notice things that I didn’t in the game. When you’re worried with surviving boss fights or doing side tasks, you can actually miss out on certain details that in animation are revealed. I also believe there’s just a really good human connection as it were that’s established between the viewer and both characters as time goes on. You understand 9s’ pain and quest for vengeance, but pity him for his misunderstandings. While you also understand A2’s desire to shut herself off from everyone. Both paths are kind of valid given the circumstances and ultimately it shows you how human the Yorha really are. The desire to love and be loved, to seek retribution for perceived wrongs and to know where we come from. These are some of the most human emotions possible. 

The production quality on this one is absurd. A-1 had a lot of the same staff who worked on 86 working on this one and it shows. It looks amazing from beginning to end with amazing fights, beautiful animation and some lovely character designs. I have to give A-1 credit for handling some very difficult fights, such as the Titan machine fights with so much quality. Like it would be so easy for them to just shoddily put some CGI together, but nope, a great blend of 2D and 3D is what we got and it looked amazing. There’s also got to be a mention of the phenomenal job by the seiyuus. 9s and A2’s seiyuu’s put in two of the best performances you’ll ever hear, especially 9s who preferably encapsulates the pain the character is in throughout this season. It’s like his voice comes through the screen and grips you. Really bravo to both of them for an incredible job.

I think most people who watched this cour will feel that it’s a pretty big upgrade in every sense, but those who haven’t seen it because you like to wait for stuff to end, rest assured this is amazing. A-1 took a very difficult story and one of my favourite games ever and brought it to the anime medium nearly flawlessly. Truly a masterclass in adaptation.

Nier Automata Cour 2 gets a very easy 10, out of 10."
56063,538611.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"While I quite enjoyed season 1, I must say this was a massive improvement in every single area. I never finished the game myself but I still thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this, if you enjoyed the first season to any degree then I cannot recommend this enough. The art continues to be great, and while in the first season the animation could look a bit stiff at times, here it was much more consistently well done, with especially the final few episodes having incredibly well animated scenes. The writing was always interesting but here I became fully hooked, at times I felt somewhat lost as tothe overarching plot but through the twists and reveals that happen you start to put it together, and on the whole the plot felt a lot more complete than the first season.

The characters were so great, I was so invested in each and every one of them and their arcs, I never thought I would get so emotionally attached to them all, even the pods.

The ending was absolutely beautiful and felt like a perfect culmination of all the strange and esoteric moments of this incredible story, definitely give it a watch."
56063,538604.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Y'all, they did it - they managed to adapt Automata in a narratively satisfying manner. I am stunned to be honest. I don't want to go into the details, but the ways they change events around make them hit so much harder than they would have, if they just adapted the game beat-for-beat. I would still recommend playing the game first, as the things they change really work having already known the original - but I can imagine anime-only watchers still being plenty engaged and shocked throughout. I was spoiled on the ending, which took me a bit out of the experience at the very end, butbesides that, I absolutely loved it.
I still prefer the game overall, but they did an amazing job.
Peak - really hoping we see an OVA or a movie expanding on some of the side materials present in the NieR universe not represented here."
56063,538823.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Anime of the Year. 10/10 *spoiler-free review* There are two distinct mindsets to be in watching this, either you have played the game and know the story or are new and watching it for the first time in this anime. I'm so jealous of the latter. This is a story that is so incredible and near to my heart that I, early on, really disliked how they started the first season. Why do we need an anime recreation of this already fantastic story, one where having choice in game makes it so much more interactive and impactful and personal and gut-wrenching. A-1 Pictures answered this withthis season.

Early on in Season 1 I felt wrong and like I actually was watching something pretty masterful. With the obvious CGI early, I was so worried and watching with my eyes covered how they would do one of my favorite moments of the game justice. Turns out they went all out and nailed it. I ws in shock and disbelief in the best way possible. But the really impactful moments in the game build later on, and as season 1 started to wrap up, I applauded the effort involved to put the first half of this story into anime form. It was great and I enjoyed it and did not have much to think about a recreation of the second half, even when it was announced and began airing. I was excited to continue the story, but it is so much more.

What A-1 Pictures and the staff and everyone involved have done here is brilliant and worth crowning it Anime of the Year. To take such an incredible story and adapt it so stunningly in its own way is more than I could ever ask for. There is not one moment of bad CGI I recall from this season. There isn't a single moment where I wasn't taken back to the story of the game and had my memories built on, in a way eerily similar to the androids. Like it re-defined what this story meant to me. And it became a crucial part in understanding it. This is not just a re-creation of the game's story. This is a continuation of it. And Yoko Taro is a madman genius and this is my anime of the year and I'm going to leave it at that.

This is something that needs to be experienced, by anime fans in general YES and for Nier fans 100/10. This is still this story. We are still up. Masterpiece.

56063,538701.0,4.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"NieR: Automata. The anime. I refrained from reviewing Part 1 as the story and presentation of the title was literally unfinished there. Part 2... I am beginning to see why people who know nothing about philosophy and think little to nothing about most things are impressed with this title. This is the same segment of the audience who will surely click ""confusing"" to this review, by the way. Even so, I intend to express a different reflection of this title's quality to express than simple awe. To begin, I make sure to state: this is a review of the ANIME -- ignoring any exclusively source-material merits, asan anime should stand on its own, at most relying on its prequels. Even if I have source material knowledge, I will deliberately not factor them in. No, I will not watch 3 or 5 hours long of fan-made explanation or head-canon videos and if someone needs to in order to have any points of dissatisfaction addressed, that's not a work standing on its own, now is it?

Moreover, given we are in 2024 and the sound and visuals are nothing impressive for this year, I'll get it over with and say: there's no bonus points to my rating added from merely meeting industry standards. No, I have no complaints about the female designs, in case anyone asks if that's why I'm not giving bonus points. I'm not about to complain about sexy female designs; in fact, I enjoy them, though they never get a bonus point on just this alone; see my criteria for grading anime for more details.

Here we go:

For those watching this anime as it's being released, a huge impact that hurts this anime is timing -- Part 1 was quite a while ago... but Part 2 took too long to release, which numbed a great deal of any emotional anticipation. Yes, this is common in today's animescape, but that does not diminish the effect. Animators, PLEASE! Just release an anime you WANT people to feel is deep or epic in one go. And not 12 episodes; that's hardly screentime to tell a truly good tale; however many episodes it takes, please! Thankfully, this point is not relevant if you aren't watching as it's coming out. In my case, as a reviewer, it gives me a more unbiased and clear-minded approach to analyze the story when any emotional workup is disrupted and neutralized so I can dissect straight into the meat of the story.

Now for the actual story -- even as someone who rarely touches videogames anymore, I heard the praises sung about this title, the game and source material that is. There's all that about how it's deep, PROFOUND! How it explores nihilism, how it explores existentialism...

As an actual living nihilist, this should excite me. Not so much in an elevation of value in the work, but as something simply stimulating for the mind on a purely biological, neurological and psychological level. After all, even people who live by active nihilism, those who actively deny objective meaning and value to keep their gaze upon the world unclouded, are still motivated by the same hormones in our carbon-based data processors called ""brains"".

Yet, one fundamental problem is, this story is like a college essay that throws a lot of big words and names around, but fails to show true comprehension and ability to explore them, often just falling into pessimistic bias in representation and ""FeeEeeeLz"". 

&gt;&gt;Human emotions are somehow forbidden... for... robots. 

Read that last sentence again. Yes. Um... Why not program and make bots to not have them? Why not just program them to be a literal goal-oriented and efficiency-driven protocol? Especially combat units. 

GPT can explain why it does not have feelings. It might take a little thinking about why an entity can outwardly behave similar to a human or perform otherwise intellect-necessary actions without feelings. It involves knowing and understanding statistics, probability and linear (tensor) algebra to begin. But, it's quite possible. We only did it this entire time in human history. No, the electronic device you hold in your hand does not have feelings, thankfully. Imagine if your smartphone could cry in pain every time you drop it by accident. Or if it had existential angst when you decided it was time for an upgrade to a new iphone or samsung for better memory or features. Who ever would invent such a feature...

Yet the logic behind machines having feelings is never explained in the show. Were YoRHa making imitation family members and substitute friends/lovers for buy or were they manufacturing combat units to decimate invading alien forces? Same question for the tin cans that YoRHa fights against.

&gt;&gt;Philosophers' names are used. Concepts get brought up. 

Yet, all coverage of this is shallow. 

A robot is named Pascal but does not touch on ""The Wager"" (which was about believing in or not believing in god and the associated consequences to believe or to not believe) that Blaise Pascal was famous for. The concept of a ""Wager"", by the way... involves betting something of value at the risk of something else of value. Nihilism... is about the world lacking inherent meaning and value. Right so, put the last two sentences together. Go on.

""2B"" teases the line ""To be or not to be"" as a nice nod to Shakespeare's Hamlet's famous soliloquy about if to live in suffering, or to defy in death. The show certainly tries to show a lot of ""suffering""; I mean, there have only been so many times where a robot was RPing as though it was in great grief, but sadly when humanity coined the concept of suffering, it meant only carbon-based lifeforms, not ChatGPT when it gets bombarded with insults for misunderstanding a user's poorly phrased run-on sentence or that poor baseball you keep swinging a bat at when you play baseball with your friends... But yeah, as there are no carbon-based lifeform sentients, suffering-RP is honestly about it. 

Religion, cults, beauty and femininity, perception of reality. Ideas like these get a mere 20 minutes with even less of the episode on some allegories that reference the most superficial layer of these ideas. There is no tie-in to how it even should be connected to the supposed central theme of nihilism and there is no dive into any of these topics at length or any direction of where to go with this. It's much like how someone throws ideas around and hope something is seen as relevant, meanwhile nothing new is added to the literature surrounding nihilism; no new ideas regarding nihilism is being added. 

Maybe I should write a book or draw a manga where I name every character after a philosopher with barely any relevance to the philosophy they are known for -- like... all the female characters could be named after a feminist, and all leadership role characters could be named after a thinker from the enlightenment. Will I get seen as a DeEp and PrOfOuNd WriTeR too...? EZ ticket to fame and fortune?

&gt;&gt;9S

Much of the juice and bulk of what makes this story ""profound"" (and that takes the bulk of the episode count of the anime's part 2) is in 9S's portrayal in that ending where he experiences ""existential despair"". The ""not 2 B"" ending where 9S is the main character of it, to euphemistically refer to the gist of that ending versus the first episode of Part 2.

...Here's the problem: in terms of psychological realism, which is what actually makes characters in stories interesting and thus, in most people's eyes, worth it to experience, this... is not how most nihilists come to realize that nihilism is very much real and undeniable. And, for most people, the reaction is first, denial. When someone tells you nothing matters in the objective, you deny it because subjectively, you have painted the illusion of value and meaning all over your own eyes. It's like covering your eyes with your hands and pretending the sky does not exist. Of course, some people will deny the truth until they die; gazing into the void isn't something every homo sapiens sapiens has the mental strength and intellectual rigor to brave. Others come to a mature realization that it's the truth. That it's all constructs that construct the world in our minds and thus are just the illusions we painted into our vision. An intangible thought paradigm that was once advantageous for survival but in lieu of imminent danger, serves as nothing more than a constricting relic of thought. An intellectual enlightenment. Then a decision of what to do with that plot twist of life occurs, often calmly.

That's the usual reaction. 

Melodramatic despair when you lose your only ""purpose""... is really not that relatable or realistic when discussing nihilism or the realization of it, which is often coined the term ""existential crisis"". Reality is just not very often that angsty.

Don't mistake the above though.

Yes, you will suffer and despair if the person you love the most dies. There is not a single person, nihilist or otherwise, who does not suffer. This is because, even for the most extreme of nihilists who actively deny objective meaning and value, the body still excretes dopamine and oxytocin which is what the ""feel"" of attachment and love are based on, physically speaking. Even if you actively know none of it matters, that none of it will objectively have intrinsic meaning or value and thus nothing was truly lost in the grand scale, your eyes will still shed tears because cortisol and prolactin are still secreted by your body to make you cry. How you proceed consciously, intellectually speaking, is what differs between a nihilist and someone who isn't one. A normal person will probably mourn, perhaps hold a funeral, perhaps go over good and bad memories and tell themselves what this meant to them. A nihilist may take a much more pragmatic approach. Some might be existentialists or absurdists who try to be passionate anyway, under the cling of subjective value. Some might take a much more mundane approach. Yet importantly, the reason this does not work when portraying 9S... is because he is supposed to be a robot per the very premise of the show. He doesn't secrete dopamine or oxytocin or any other hormone, and I have no reason to believe the combat androids are the bodies humanity were supposed to transfer into and thus need these functions. So then, why is he acting like someone who is governed by hormonal cycles and systems that form the physical foundation of human emotion? Was he a role-play AI who is supposed to generate emotional character text instead? Maybe RPing enemies to ""death"" was a combat tactic here?

The same thing applies for discovering that what you were doing the whole time did not matter. Biologically and psychologically speaking, there will be a reaction. It will be tailored to what that specific situation is. But again, 9S is a robot. And for an android designed to fight, even in a scout role, I cannot see the advantage of having it secrete and be affected by dopamine, oxytocin or any other hormone let alone engage in what can be observed as role-play behavior when you talk to AI that are programmed and trained to act like fictional characters. The narrative logic here simply does not compute for why combat units need emotion.

This is why 9S's portrayal when he is the focus and in grief is problematic because it is pure theatrical, emo angst. There is no exploration of a realistic realization of nihilism that would be typical of a normal human being who is undergoing an intellectual enlightenment of their view of the world or an exploration of the psychology of loss, even if we ignore the narrative flaw that a robot somehow has the hormone secretion and effect cycle called ""emotion"" as if he was just a naive boy until the big despair happens.

""Nothing matters"" and emo screaming with tears, the trope.

...And that's all there is to it.

So, how does this impact the story?

Well, once you stripped all the ""profound"" down, this anime boils down to, two robots who take orders from a super powerful organization, they do missions, and then in various ways, things went poof.

This isn't profound. 

My reaction to the entire thing was blasé.

9S's emo and angsty portrayal had me laughing at the attempt at illustrating a philosophy I know as well as the taste of bread. The stereotype that ""nihilism is despair"", is too old and so poorly represents the rare individuals who are truly nihilists in life. I for one find it quite liberating to not be fettered by the prescribed meanings and values of the world around me, by the way. And, I'd choose no other way of life than to abandon definitions and paradigms meant to have me submit.

To its credit, 

At least this anime is not another isekai or reverse isekai where the main character, male or female, is effectively god, or the avatar of popularity. It's at least trying to do the thing I loved about some older anime: having a theme, something to think about. 

Unfortunately, the lack of depth and the stereotyped portrayal of nihilism as despair, coupled with the fact that the characters themselves are just robots with unrealistic melodramatic reactions to stuff that occurs and say stereotypically emotional lines, the experience of watching this anime is truly closer as an experience of reading to a shallow forum post. It’s akin to an ENTP or INTP debater on a forum who writes the first sentence of every point he wants to make but fails to complete the paragraph for any of the points and then goes on a rant in the middle, ending up with a shallow, scattered post that then loses the debate altogether because it lacks the actual focus and incisiveness their INTJ debate partner can muster. Or, maybe I should consider this public domain philosophy texts, the commercial -- with 2B as the marketting waifu to entice those who would otherwise be too bored to study philosophy.

4/10

This is where the meat of the game was and the adaptation is doing a great job translating the game to a non interactive medium. Animation quality is in my opinion better then season one and the show knows when to go all out. Soundtrack is always on point and even better utilized then in season one. The story does stay pretty much on course with a few deviations that were already setup in part one. Fans of the game might enjoy that there's plenty of side story/novella content being adapted thatwasn't in the game (or just on terminals) and there are a few easter eggs to the Nier Reincarnation gacha game as well.
The people that make this show are clearly fans of the work that they are adapting and are paying homage to many key moments of the game within the show and I absolutely appreciate their dedication to doing it justice. Especially the title card and bunker scene at the beginning of the season.

Now that the season is over I can say that I am really glad that we got this adaptation, it changed enough to be worth watching even for people that have played the game and it also fleshes out some characters that, at least for me, didn't really grow on me in my playthrough. Not everything shown in the anime will stick the landing for anime only watchers because there is a good amount of fan service (not that kind but there is also plenty of that) but it's a great watch regardless and may even bring more people into the franchise as a whole.

For me it's a 9/10."
56063,538927.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"From the very opening, that beautiful song by LiSA (way more compatible with Automata than the Aimer's one), I had the feeling this 2nd part of the series was gonna be better than the first... and: YES, it definitely is. Maybe it's just me, but the art and animation (both 2D and 3D) seem much more polished now, although, unfortunately, the use of music through the action is almost as random as in the 1st cour. I insist this show should've been A2's story, with enough 2B and 9S to complete the picture, because when ""Ver1.1a"" is its OWN THING, is when it's at its very best.That, saddly, doesn't mean the series stops being a hostage of the video game, but at least now it's a graceful one. (You might still have a hard time understanding some things, though, especially if new to the mythos).
Daring and bold changes end up making sense and tell a story that -when it allows itself- becomes complementary to the Drakengard/NieR universe, even defying the weak product it appeared to be in the beginning. Thanks to this, ""Ver1.1a"" finally fully exercises its identity and walks its own way firmly.
Despite 9S's obsession with 2B sometimes being borderline inverosimile, some annoying anime tropes (like: boy talks, girl continues, both say something cheesy at the same time... I hate this!) and the overall storytelling and direction being very inferior to the video game's, I'm glad to be able to say that I can recommend this anime, because its strengths manage to outdo its weaknesses and, fortunately, delivers a pretty solid experience.
You'll still have to ""bear"" with the 1st cour, but rest assured things will get better -way better- once it finishes and this one starts.
Final note: One could NEVER get tired of the hauntingly beautiful ending song and animation. Don't skip these ones and check the official music video on YouTube!"
56063,538747.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"This was an great watch from start to finish. I usually always go into a video game adaptation with some suspicions because of how it is treated in the west, but I cam out of season one surprised. I hopped into season two and my blown expectations were further exploded. The story takes a pretty linear path. It did its best with given how the original source had branching paths. The plot was able to dive into different paths and still tell a coherent story. Much like the game, the story is great. It got me thinking about life and existentialism because of sentient machinery.The end was nice. It deterred from the original a bit (I won't spoil here) but it's still a nice touch. It wrapped everything up and left me wanting more. 

The art was amazing. It has been awhile since I've seen such a beautifully drawn and animation series. You can tell there was a lot of love and passion placed into the series to get it done. The style mixed both 2d and CGI animation; the integration was smooth. There are times where it was a bit out of place but the storytelling and background work doesn't make you linger on it for long. The style is very fitting towards the original and for animation sake (getting simplified a bit).

All of the characters were casted amazingly. Everyone's voice fit their character with how much emotion was portrayed. The characters themselves followed the source material. They're flawed yet powerful. All of the characters deals with loneliness, death, meaning of their existence, friendship, family, and so forth. All of these themes lets the viewers relate more on a personal level even if  they're all machinery.

This is a must watch. Even if you're not into the video games or never heard of the series, check it out. It's made for everyone and not only for those that has seen the source material already."
56063,538779.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Nier:Automata was an incredible gem upon it's arrival as a video game, but I was always curious about how it could be adapted to the anime format, but they surprisingly did this a lot of justice. Obviously the first season could be argued it was a bit stronger. This one does remove a few characters some of which really made the series a lot more entertaining, and a few of the decisions made here may have been something I wouldn't have done, but this ultimately is still a great season 2 for the series. As a fan of the games, it definitely captures the lookand feel of the game. It does a great job of bringing this to an anime, and the story would be very difficult to adapt. The team surprisingly nailed it, and managed to not only make this one of the better examples of a video game brought to a TV/Movie medium, but will hopefully continue to show that there is a space for these stories to be told in an anime format. 

Overall, this one is definitely worth checking out. It wouldn't require you to play the game, but I can't promise when you are done that you won't want to. The characters are really interesting, and the story it tells along the way make this something that anime fans really shouldn't miss out on."
56063,539721.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"This incredible story from YOKO TARO finally came to the anime format in this great animation. While yes they couldn't include all the side quests from the game they made an incredible story combining the other forms of media in which this story is told (Like the Pearl Harbor Descent Manga) that are'nt even fully covered if you were to just play the game. A some of the great atmosphere the game has is well preserved in these episodes, however i can't comment on how they impacted the flow of the story as i already knew where all of the story was going, it looked abit rushed tho.

The only crime this anime commits is not utilizing fully the soundtrack form the game as it's ost, i sincerelly think that neither oppening or ending came close to what it could have been if they worked with the original soundtrack creators."

57217,538235.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Mahoaku is a fitting tribute to late mangaka Fujiwara Cocoa. She was sadly never able to see her work finished or adapted into anime, but studio Bones were able to follow the framework she left behind and stayed true to the spirit of the original manga while adding their own respectful touch. A simple and wholesome that romance fans of all walks of life will enjoy. I’m a massive sucker for the star crossed/forbidden lovers trope. I love seeing two people from vastly different backgrounds come together, fall in love and overcome despite the odds. Mimori and Mira are supposed to be sworn enemies, yetthe more time they spend together the more they realise they have in common and enjoy each other’s company. These 12 minute long episodes were pure bliss and seeing the purity with which they both looked at each other and yearned to deepen their bond really resonated with me. Mira might be an “evil lieutenant” but he’s one of the kindest fellas you’ll see, and the extent of his cruelty is wanting to see Mimori embarrassed because of how cute she looks. Mimori is basically cuteness personified, and her childlike naïveté about the world was adorable to watch. Because of her backstory and circumstances as a magical girl, her time with Mira is basically a learning experience for her. She gets to see what the outside world is like and learn about people other than her creepy familiar.

Which perfectly leads into my ONE issue with this show. The rapey familiar. Mimori’s familiar basically sexually harasses her nonstop in this show and takes advantage of her financially. Luckily he’s only in a few episodes, but when he does show up it really just kills the vibe. I’m not sure what purpose he’s really serving narratively being that way, maybe Fujiwara sensei thought it was funny or her editor did.. but for me it didn’t land and just made me uncomfortable. Mimori is the sweetest and most wholesome girl ever so having a dude want her to walk around naked, or work at a host bar or try to grope her just didn’t sit right with me. The story also tries to redeem him somewhat in one of the final episodes where the theme is basically “he’s a pos, but he’s the only family Mimori has and she loves him anyway” I wouldn’t say this was a minor detail of the story, but certainly not big enough to detract from my overall positive impressions of the show and how sweet Mira and Mimori relationship was.

Other than Mimori familiar, the other side characters are great. Hibana, the cursing mahou shoujo had me dead every scene she was in from just how vulgar she is. Mira’s evil company colleagues were just as nice as he is, which kind of begs the question, who are they supposed to be evil to? These people are all genuinely amazing. I wish we would’ve seen a little more of them honestly, but sadly that’s probably just due to Fujiwara sensei not being able to finish the story and flesh things out more. You can definitely feel there was some more story to squeeze out here and we’ll just never really know unfortunately.

The show looks gorgeous. I haven’t seen a ton of Bones stuff, their work is usually solid, but I’ve never seen it look this good. It’s so pretty, vibrant and even though it’s a seinen manga, there’s some shojo vibes going on. This is a big part of my enjoyment of the story because Mimori’s faces are so cute, I love the chibi style they go with in some scenes. Just a really sweet time.

Mahoaku episodes are only 12 minutes long and don’t overstay their welcome, so if you’re into romance anime there’s really no reason not to check this one out. It’s a very sweet and wholesome story that will feel like a sugar rush. I’ll miss it. My only reason for not giving it a max score is that we don’t see a kiss or actual relationship by the end which again is likely because Bones didn’t want to disrespect the original work by going too far ahead and giving an original ending.

Mahoaku gets 9 out of 10."
57217,538231.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"The Magical Girl and the Evil Lieutenant Used to Be Archenemies - Between the never-ending battle of good and evil, Love is (always) War. What comes to your mind when it comes to love and romance? I'm sure there's a lot of things that you can think of, but when it's all summed up, it's a complicated affair. Just as every romance has its own excessive use of melodrama, so too is the ever-oversaturated combo of the mix known as the rom-com genre. Many people choose to display the rom-com genre by their own agendas, but at the end of the day, there's always a coupleformed at the end of the way, even if at the whimsical wishes of the shipping wars. And in this season, more than the trials and tribulations of dealing with good and evil, the warm-hearted feeling of good and evil seemingly protecting each other in secret, now that's what you call an escapade. May I introduce to you: Katsute Mahou Shoujo to Aku wa Tekitai shiteita. a.k.a The Magical Girl and the Evil Lieutenant Used to Be Archenemies, or shortened to MahoAku, the very last and unfinished work of beloved late author Cocoa Fujiwara, who tragically passed away in March 2015, her most famous work being Winter 2012's Inu × Boku: Secret Service.

As always, with the current trend of anime with cancel culture and all, most people would see a couple with a sizable age gap and say: ""This is not possible at all, cancel the anime!"" To that I say, please remove your spectacles of criticism and see this from a different POV.

With that out of the way, this is just a very simple romance story between good and evil: the evil organization that's led by Mira to bring waste to Earth, and the faction of good that is always traditionally associated with: Mahou Shoujo i.e. Magical Girls, to protect the peace and harmony on the same planet, led by Byakuya Mimori. And you know what they say about first impressions in the romantic tense: ""From the moment I saw you, I can't take my eyes off you. Shall we date?"" Yelp, I just felt the cringe writing this sentence for the review, someone help me xD

Being in the Shoujo sense that's marketed as a Shonen work, I have to say that from the moment that Mira laid his eyes on Mimori, I am immediately smitten by their pure and unadulterated relationship, more than what the average Joe can only summarize of a disgusting love between a minor and an adult that it's just sick to imagine. To be fair, those of you who've watched or read Inu × Boku: Secret Service (which I will applaud you if you have done so) would have caught on that this is Cocoa Fujiwara's signature trait of the adults protecting the children, with the progression of the bond translating into a romantic relationship, and MahoAku is pretty much in the exact same ballpark as said series, only in a more sweet and diabetic way that most couples could ever dream of a enemies-to-lovers storyline, that the male MC just can't simply get over his crush so much so that it not only cost him his heart but also many pairs of glasses in the process, as predictable and excessive as it is to go crazy over her.

With both Mira and Mimori doing all they can to preserve their secret taboo of a relationship that must not be found out by their colleagues, it's definitely a battle to the very end if they're exposed. Moreover, the colleagues on either side...are not normal people at all, if ever concerned for trivial instances. Mira may be the evil Lieutenant, but he has colleagues ranging from the lazy Fomalhaut, the free and easy-going ""couple"" of Alcyone and Spica, as well as the yandere fantasizing of Bellatrix. And as if this crazy crowd of evil colleagues are the insanity that Mira can't exactly control, Mimori has it hard too with her Mr. Cat Familiar, who came to the world to assist her...or rather, request her to do things that should not be exposed to the innocent and purity of the young teenager girl who works odd jobs by day and night, and even with fellow Magical Girls in the form of Hibana Kagari with her Familiar of Betelgeuse, whom she can only swear as a form of admitting her approval. God, I can't tell you how much of a comedic relief Hibana is being excessive in her vulgarism; that's her natural sense of speech, it always gets me laughing each and every time. This is a cast of characters that you will not want to get on their bad side, or they'll torment you with the tools of their choosing.

I'm actually very surprised that studio Bones was chosen for this side project, considering that aside from the staple that is My Hero Academia and the recent new seasons of Bungou Stray Dogs over the last 2 years or so (let's just forget about the mess that was Winter's underwhelming and studio-anniversary insulting Metallic Rouge), the studio is going all guns blazing on the complete adaptation of the popular Shonen series franchise that they've started since Spring 2016. Still, it's good to see some diversity with the studio adapting stuff like this, that shows the versatility of Bones with their last handful of great series from Vanitas no Carte and the recent conclusion of Mob Psycho 100. And I feel that MahoAku stands together with the other shows in Bones's biography quite well with its adaptation under female director Akiyo Ohashi, whose directorial works range only with the 2020 BL film of Umibe no Étranger a.k.a The Stranger by the Shore and the Given: Movie's OVA the year after. Even with less experience, this half-episode series is still notable because she has to make clear cut decisions to thread the unfinished manga that Cocoa Fujiwara left behind into the anime, and that's no easy feat to adapt and create both existing and original content that still feels like an open-and-shut case of consistency.

The music is a feels ride, not gonna lie. Lezel's half-episode OP song is one of the most beautiful and rhythmic songs I've heard this season and is such a perfect fit for a series like this. I can take it or leave it with the ED featuring both Miya and Mimori's VAs, but it's just decent.

The show being a great sign-off to the late female mangaka, I hope that she is able to see this work from Heaven, because this is a small lil' series that truly respects the work that goes behind not just the anime, but also paying the tribute with the foundation from the manga that's an honour to the loving memory of Cocoa Fujiwara.

MahoAku's a wholesome, cutesy, dramatic rom-com despite the age gap, without a shadow of ANY doubt."
57217,538251.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"It can be really hard to try and destroy everything in the world as an evil Lieutenant, when you fall in love with the enemy at first sight. The Magical Girl and the Evil Lieutenant is a romcom where we follow the Evil Lieutenant Mira and the Magical girl Mimori. They are enemies that start to develop a forbidden relationship, which is shown through some short episodes that highlight their ups and downs. The plot for the show is very simple, and follows how Mira and Mimori go from enemies to forming a romantic relationship. This is supported by the whole aspect of it being a forbiddenlove and that the two of them come from completely different backgrounds. They also use some classic tropes, as plots for some of the episodes, but they are done with style and their own twists. All of it makes the plot generally seem like a very sweet little romance story.

For characters it is very limited how much time is spent on others then Mira and Mimori, since the show has short episodes. But even though side characters don't have much time to shine, is the show not afraid of giving them very bold personality traits and showing it off. When it comes to our main characters, do we get a slow but steady progression for them, where they very much carry the romance part of the show, while the side characters do most of the comedy aspect of the show. Which gives a nice balance between being overwhelmed by the cute moments and having a small laugh.

For the style of the show is it a more simplistic style, where most focus is on the characters and the background is less interesting. But they also have a very specific style throughout, which is their high use of pastel colors, this choice gives the show a calming effect to it and helps keep the story sweet and cutesy.

Overall each episode of this show is a quick shot of sweet and cutesy romance with a side of comedy. So if that is something you like or if you need something sweet and positive to watch, would i recommend you watch this show."

The third and final volume of the manga was published a full year later after consulting with her family so as to serve as the finale. The anime, made a full decade later in her memory, is a sweet romance that makes fun of the usual magical girl tropes. Mira is our straight laced lieutenant. Just think straight A honor student, class president, five million afterschool classes, calculating kind of guy. Now make him a simp and you got it! For some reason his reactionis to always throw his credit card at the girl lol!

Byakuya is our wilting flower of a magical girl. Soft spoken, gentle, feminine, stupid. Now throw in perpetually broke and works every job under the sun (and moon!). You got it! 

The forbidden love trope never gets old but here the series does lean more on the ""moe"" factor to turn Mira into a simp defender. It's very upfront about it too so you see his reaction coming a mile away which just adds to the fun. 

Normally I hate the wilting flower trope but the anime is very aware of the genre tropes and actually plays them up so it's more of a shared joke with the viewer than anything. 

It's sweet and at 12 minutes per episode doesn't over stay it's welcome. Also it helps that the feelings are mutual, in most shows the female lead will act oblivious throughout, having the feelings returned was far better. My one complain is that the show doesn't really end but sadly that can't be helped considering the circumstances."

Anyway, it’s short, but still manages to convey a lot in the limited time. Sure, there’s ecchi, crudeness from the “Angel” and comedic profanity from the other magical girl, but those help to balance the absolute sweetness of the relationship between the Magical Girl and the Evil Lieutenant. Ifyou can roll with that and like a sweet and simple romcom, this is perfect.  They both love one another and meet every day and there’s little progression, but it’s evident by the end… and it perfectly accomplishes what it sets out to do.  It certainly doesn’t ever feel like it’s dragging like many romcoms.

It’s hard to really put so much into so few episodes, but for example, Dusk Maiden of Amnesia did a great job in pulling me in and making me care...these episodes were half as long, but the tempo was great and didn’t suffer.  Masterful storytelling and editing to fit the allotted time and still leave you satisfied without leaving you feeling either clueless or that there was too much “filler” or dragging things out.  No… this was just right.

The supporting cast gets just enough time to leave you wanting more of them and to get a basic grasp of their personalities- a testament to the writing and the talents of the VAs.  The leads were phenomenal.  You don’t get to see more, but you feel the depth is there.

The art and music were beautiful.

Spoiler (ish) but not really:
I can imagine a world where it keeps going and there are antics and more exploring of the various characters.  Maybe we would meet the King.  Maybe if it went on long enough, they would eventually progress farther or even marry and try to hide things or maybe it would end there or with the revelation that everyone already knew, or something more like in other stories… but we know we won’t get that and that’s ok because what we got was beautiful and ended on a perfect note with a heartwarming feeling of “see you tomorrow” like it was meant to.  We can imagine those futures.

The fact it manages to stir so much feeling in 12 episodes of each less than 12 minutes makes it top-tier to me."
57217,538827.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I really love this anime. The art style is really cute and fluffy. Very standard romcom with magic. This anime is sweet, cutsie and gives fuwa-fuwa feels. If you're looking for something funny and that's easy to watch, this is for you.(⁠◍⁠•⁠ᴗ⁠•⁠◍⁠) (The manga is unfinished so I doubt it's going to have a new season.) Just now, (like literally just now.) I learned that the first manga that I have ever read (watashi no ookami-san) is one of the works of the mangaka. Check it out! 💝 Kudos to all the people who made her work into anime. May she rest in peace. 🩷"
57217,538245.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I picked this up late in the season thinking it would be a quick binge with its short episodes with some solid animation (that OP pops off). Considering it had a decent romantic/comedic hook a la Romeo and Juliet but with magical girls, I figured the jokes would become stale with simple characters and a sort of slow building romance between our leads that would inevitably lead to a late season shared affection and kiss. I was very wrong in the best way. The relationship between the leads, in particular, is both funnier than I expected and far more touching. Yes, its jokes can get a littlerepetitive, but they’re varied enough to keep things at least somewhat interesting, particularly by bringing in external parties who may or may not be familiar with their little tryst. While there is a slow build in their relationship, it’s not as early days as I thought, either; these characters have known each other for quite some time and have a strong rapport with one another. And it’s not quite like Romeo and Juliet. Mira is under pressure to defeat and potentially even kill her, but to Byakuya, this is a day job (well... mostly, she does seem to have a high affinity for it), one of many she’s doing to keep herself and her weird anthropomorphic cat familiar from dying of starvation in the cold. She can seem entirely unaware at times, but she also knows what Mira’s job is and has largely accepted that she’s on the chopping block. Despite all that, she loves him, and Mira can hardly contain his affection for her (it literally destroys more than one pair of glasses per episode), so their love is more blatant than most series of this ilk.

This series also lets its side characters drive a good deal of the humor. The presence of Hibana, another magical girl who is stronger than Byakuya, but also far more chaotic is the funniest element in the show, particularly as she’s outright violent towards those she loves and her use of a certain four letter “f-word” in place of other words is quite extensive. Her familiar, the balding Bird, is quite different from Byakuya’s Cat and they are regularly at odds over their mission (whatever that is). The evil organization that Mira largely directs is composed of all kinds of quirky characters, even if they do feel a little tropey (Formalhaut in particular might as well be more golden retriever than man).

Honestly, this show is kinda perfect, at least insofar as it does just about everything it can with its limited premise. It’s not narratively driven and thus there’s little actual progression beyond the central relationship. There are hints at worldbuilding that I would have liked to see expanded upon substantially. There’s very little in the way of backstory for Mira in particular. The series also largely drops its early amazing visuals, particularly involving the girls’ transformations and fights, to put the focus elsewhere so it loses some of its initial head of steam. It’s hard to blame this series too much for what it lacks, though, since the ~12 minute episodes render this season at roughly half the length of a normal single cour season. For a series with such limited opportunity to build itself out, it does a surprisingly solid job investing me in its characters.

By the end, though I'm certainly wishing for more, I'm happy with what we got. It's just a joy to see this series through since it does everything it's trying to do pretty well, even if it doesn't really push the envelope. It leaves me wanting a bit in the magic department, even avoiding showing Byakuya's misfortune magic that I would have loved to see, but hopefully a second season will be forthcoming to fill in the gaps."
57217,540181.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I went into it without knowledge of what had happened to the author or why the episodes were so short (12 min long give or take). Almost skipped it because of how short they were if I'm being honest but the fmc dragged me in just like how the Lieutenant got dragged in. She's adorable and that's always a good point I look for when it comes to these types of anime. I watched it in its entirety and I wanted more. Looking at comments I found out the author was no longer with us and that the manga didn't make it all that far..Sadness. 

I give it a 9/10. Barely ever give things a 10 so a 9 is as good as it gets. I'm sure not everyone will agree but I'm sucker for these types of anime/works. Not too mushy and not too stale. Just the right amount. If you are looking for a fully fleshed out story, again, the author passed and the story was basically in its starting point so there not exactly much story progression what's so ever other than the relationship between the magical girl and the evil lieutenant. I recommend regardless of this for those who enjoy romance with some comedy in it."
57217,539568.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"It is quite cute and wholesome, especially the romance. The angels are really funny at times. There are some gags that are overused and fall flat. Each 12-minute episode has opening and ending credits which make each episode more like only seven to eight minutes. It is so short that there is virtually no reason not to give this show a try. Despite being a magical girl show, there is no action fights. It's just a slow quirky rom com. The show doesn't have much plot progression, though that is to be expected with the limited length of content. The romance goes somewhere while alsonot going somewhere (no opinion on the matter; just wholesome; your here for the relationship not the plot). The show focuses in on the relationship between our two main characters while leaving the two organizations they are part of as very surface level and peripheral. It's not a show for someone expecting a focused look on the job of a magic girl or evil villain organization. The show likes its quiet moments as much as its loud moments, expect some balance between quiet rom and rambunctious com. Though it leans more toward the com side of things as most romcoms do."
57217,538540.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"If there's any show that can be described as inducing diabetes with the one true pair's sweet chemistry, it is the anime 'The Magical Girl and the Evil Lieutenant Used to Be Archenemies.' The basic premise is that the evil lieutenant Mira is tasked to conquer the world and the magical girl Mimori Byakuya is tasked to stop him. But instead of the standard good v evil and a monster of the week that magical girls like Sailormoon are facing, this anime took an unexpected turn. Mira, upon seeing Byakuya, immediately fell in love with her. So they started dating. Whilst he is rationalising that heis doing it for research, he is just someone who acts like a fool in the presence of the person they fell for, and the rest of the story is just funny situations but there's no conflict. 

The first thing one will notice is that each episode is only half the length of the usual anime episode. That's because several years ago, the mangaka Fujiwara Kokoa died before she had even gotten to the meat of her story. The source material only had 3 volumes but her previous work Inu × Boku SS had 11 volumes. We can only speculate that had she lived to complete her story, a proper plot with the necessary conflicts would have been introduced. Alas! We are just left to watch the incredible chemistry of Mira and Byakuya as they date. We also learn that Byakuya had to take odd jobs and they eat whatever stuff Mira brings to her.

Anyway, since the story only involves them dating, the half-episode length can be both a strength and a weakness. Unlike other anime of a similar nature, where the main draw is the chemistry of the pair, it hits the sweet spot that it's not too long. It's also a good thing that it's not discrete skits thrown together to make one incoherent episode, unlike another anime I described as a 'torture watch.' But with only half episodes of a great and enjoyable anime, it leaves you with the feeling akin to having blue balls. The anime adopted the manga as is and did not bother creating an anime-original ending. Whether that's a good thing or not, it's up to you to decide. 

Some have commented on the great art direction of this show. What I liked most was the heart-shaped backdrop of the Ferris wheel as Mira was instantly attracted to Byakuya. I checked the manga, and it's an anime original. Thus, I conclude that the story in the manga is probably good but some decorations were added by the studio to create a nice æsthetic, something that pays tribute to the late mangaka. 

In conclusion, this is an anime that's worth watching. I promise you that you won't notice the time passing by because you'll be so engrossed watching their chemistry."
57217,538337.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Sweet romance anime, it's what you'd call a diabetes anime. But lacks a proper ending and it almost makes the whole show empty, which is a shame. An original ending would've been the right call. So yeah, the story just doesn't end, there's no finale or a climax and makes you question if it was even worth it to watch 12 (half) episodes of progression for nothing. But it really is just a sweet magical girl romance anime, it's probably safe to assume that the main story is not even important and it's more about having cute scenes and smaller storylines. The characters are good but withlimited screen time we don't see most of them for more than a few minutes in total, once again the anime suffers because of its short episodes. Obviously with the mangaka passing the studio was already limited to what they can achieve, but normal length episodes would've made wonders for this show, even at the cost of ""fillers"".

If you don't mind that there's no closure and you only care about diabetic romantic moments and cuteness then this could be for you, giving it a try is easier with 12 min per ep."

Along the way you'll be introduced to one of the funniest characters in Anime. Oh yea. That one is NOT kid safe. Her vocabulary is basically one four letter word. Any you'll be laughing out loud. Can good and evil really make it work? Willthe evil organization that sounds like it was founded by Pinky And The Brain actually take over the world? Can the magical girls stop them?

57864,540669.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"“As far as I know, there is still more stuff to be adapted, as the novels kept going (and keep going, I think?), but seeing how this entry had a fitting ending with no loose ends, I don’t think that seeing more is really necessary, and I’m not the only one it seems, seeing that nothing else of it was released for five years now.” This is something that I wrote on my last Monogatari anime review, published on September last year, and then on December I finished and reviewed the manga. Meaning, I called this continuation to existence and every Monogatari fan out there oweit to me.

Jokes aside, this is a hard entry to judge, as it adapts two novels and one of them consists of lots of mini stories in an anthology-like manner. Yet the series does a good job in building and maintaining a continuity between them, and they also build themselves from previous events and character interactions, so it’s fine.

For half of the show the focus switches from Koyomi to the girls, which is good for giving them spotlight and continuing to flesh them out. 

The first story about Tsukihi is mostly silly and about pretending, but it is also interesting for what it means, and to see Ononoki trying to keep doing her mission. Another nice detail is how the episode forms a sort of narrative loop with something so silly as eating ice cream. But the best things is how it uses previous events and apparitions in it, and how it builds up the following events with Ononoki and Nadeko.

There are questionable things in its writing, which Ononoki tries to excuse as not being much as she fucking up but rather all result of Tsukihi’s apparition. That could be considered bad or genius writing depending of how picky or casual you are, for me it was just ok.

The bad part is how Ononoki can’t notice the most logical things throughout the episode, and is another character the one that has to resolve the problem appearing out of nowhere. Also amnesia and a comical loop. 

After that it comes an arc about Nadeko where they try to solve an issue looking for an easy way out, and it backfires, so there’s the good message in there. It also serves to flesh out her by having her both metaphorically and literally confronting and coming to terms with her past self, in different variants, and struggling as an artist and being pressured by her parents and time, now as a teenager.

And the best part is how she had to solve the problem almost completely by herself, and how there wasn’t any perverted content in it, and even the slightly more explicit stuff that you could count as such served the narrative, so it’s not fanservice. Overall I consider it to be one of the best arcs I’ve seen from the franchise.

Time seems to be an important topic in the “Off” part of the season, almost as it telling that a certain time is already off and it moved to a new one, or that characters are running out of time. 

Not trying to overthink it, but visually the directing regularly matches an object or Ononoki spinning around more than usual while talking about trying to take advantage of time, with following shots of clocks running, so that brought the thought to my mind.

Speaking of visuals, this entry keeps the usual standard of the franchise, which is of course very high. The new designs for the characters are nice, the special effects with little CGI and the backgrounds are still trippy and dynamic to look at. The occasional changes in style are there although not as prominent. The occasional texts are no longer passages from the light novels and are not as long nor as quick, so they are easier to see and read. And the directing has something happening all the time to make up for the occasional lack of motion, which is in fact less than in previous installments, despite having less stuff happening in it.
 
What’s new is the lack of fanservice, perhaps because the entry isn’t a harem but since I always bitch about the ecchi, I was very pleased with this change. Also, since Nadeko is an important character, lots of moments implement sheets and manga as part of the visuals, and bookshelves used for stairs-like transitions, very creative. There is also some occasional live action footage for the backgrounds as well.

The sound remains the same, good sound effects, very good voice acting, the soundtrack didn’t impress me, the visuals and the lyrics of the ending are good but the song is a very happy pop tune of which I’m not fan of, and the background music sounds like synthwave. Not that I’m complaining, I like to listen to the genre from time to time, but it is still as unremarkable as the soundtrack of the franchise always was for me. The opening is a reference/update of that famous Nadeko opening that most people seem to like, so it was fine for what the arc goes for thematically.

The next arc is the short origin story of Kiss Shot, showing how some of her traits came to be, such as her name, way of speaking and laughing, and how she became a vampire. The story itself is like a classic dark fairy tale, and it perfectly represents the idea of how naming conventions determine so many characteristics of the supernatural creatures in this world and franchise. 

At the same time, despite having a serious tone, the conflict feels very first world problem to me, and the characters don’t seem to take it that seriously for me to care. Plus when you think about it, it makes it seem like Kiss Shot never showed her real personality in the franchise in retrospect, but at least gave more meaning to some of her speech patterns during silly moments. Speaking of silly moments, that’s what the logic of the characters and the naming conventions in the arc were like to me. 

Oh, and it builds upon previously shown information in Zoku Owarimonogatari, which I didn’t bother to review because I found very little to say about it besides it being a what if fanservice story that is even practically erased by the end of it so what’s the point?

Overall I found it to be a very unnecessary and mediocre arc that didn’t add nothing of interest. At least visually it was pretty great. It suffers from lacking motion but makes up for it with painting like illustrations, gothic aesthetics reminiscent of Castlevania or Shinbo’s earlier works like Le Portrait de Petit Cosette, a special short intro that was like a shadow play with even set pieces simulating an actual theater, though I think the whole thing was made in CGI, but still looked very cool.

Heck, even the scenes were separated in acts like in an actual play. And although there was no opening, the music was pretty immersive, except for the ending which remained the same as before and didn’t really fit one bit.

The next arc goes back to present time yet builds up right from the end of the previous one as it has Suicide Master meddling in Japan and being part of several attacks towards girls from the Naoetsu school. 

In this arc Koyomi goes back to being the protagonist and the whole thing is once again played out as a mystery of sorts, plus it builds up good reasons for having several characters being involved in the conflict and having a specific role in it.

Unlike the previous arcs, the tone goes back to being somewhat humorous as it was the case with previous entries, but at least there is still absence of fanservice, so I don’t complain.

Even the aesthetics are closer to what the franchise has shown before the rest of this entry, both in visual presentation and music. But I have to praise the opening for going back to the ones you would expect from one about Shinobu, and for that jazzy theme. She always gets the best openings it seems. 

What I don’t fancy much, was the conclusion. For such a big deal that the reunion between the two vampires seemed to be, it felt lacking to me, even when I understand their laughs now.

Also although the reasoning of the main characters to find out the villain seemed fine, I don’t think there was enough information or build up to how she got to know about them, and the villain herself was just an edgy, nihilistic, suicidal teenager that got defeated with one hit before not really feeling that she actually learned her lesson. Overall it was a fine arc but with a bit of a lacking resolution.

As a whole I found it to be an ok addition to the franchise, mostly for the aesthetics, the lack of fanservice, the girls being looked into without Araragi around, and for the Nadeko arc. But I want to be clear, if that arc wasn’t here, I would have considered the season to be overall mediocre."
57864,540702.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"The curtains finally close on the latest entry of the Monogatari Series. An installment in the franchise that, before airing, had many fans dreading the potential disappointment that it could’ve been due to recent troubles within the animation studio and the five-year hiatus the show had been on during this. Thankfully, what we actually got in the end was a continuation of the series that, as far as I’ve understood, surpassed everyone's expectations (mine included). I'll be the first to admit that you could certainly feel the stiffness of the animation at times, but the oh-so-important style and direction of the franchise is unquestionably stillthere. If a couple of janky moments is what it costs to get a production like this, then I’d gladly pay the price any day of the week. It’s inspiring seeing Studio Shaft stay true to their form this far into the game, utilizing the myriad of possibilities that this medium provides you with to make some of the most visually engaging content in the industry. 

I believe that it also helps that this season adapts some exceptional stories from the source material as well. I found myself thoroughly enjoying all three of them for completely different reasons, just as you’ve come to expect from this show.

-You get a single-episode story that’s just plain fun in the regular ol’ Nisioisin way.
-You also have a fantastically entertaining, yet deeply thought-provoking character introspective of someone whose story you thought had ended, yet had actually just begun.
-And lastly, the season finishes with a story that takes itself a bit more seriously, which in the process casually recontextualizes basically the whole series… yet again.

Outstanding stuff, it’s all there. 

If there’s one last gripe with this season that I have to point out, it’d be the music. While all of the new tracks are genuinely great, they’re almost composed to a point where they kind of distract from the rest of the scene. Monogatari’s score has always been very “BGM:ish” due to its relatively low amount of physical action, and all of the dialogue doesn’t lend itself that well to the loud and attention-grabbing pieces that are heavily featured in these episodes. But that’s a very gratuitous nitpick, I just felt like I should have more to say about the continuation of my favorite anime. 

All in all, I can't wait to see what's next in store for this franchise. Hopefully, they keep the ball rolling, and we have multiple seasons of amazing content ahead of us. In the meantime, let's hope they finally get to translating the rest of the visual novels."
56538,532843.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"After more than a decade, most of us had abandoned any hope of ever getting more Kimi ni Todoke. So when news broke that we’d get another season, fans were naturally ecstatic. But as we all know, getting a new season of a show you grew up watching many years later can be a mixed trick bag often resulting in more misses than hits. Fortunately I can say Production IG understood the assignment here. Not only is Kimi ni Todoke season 3 just as magical as we remember the series, it’s honestly better. While not a full adaptation of the manga, it feels like theperfect stopping point for the anime and is a must watch for any shoujo fan old or new.

Unlike seasons 1 and 2, season 3 being a Netflix production dropped all at once with 5  1 hour long episodes which although I was initially critical of, I actually came to really appreciate as the way the stories were put together in each episode flowed so well. The hour long runtimes actually go by in the blink of an eye thanks in large part to an even better story than seasons 1 and 2. While I loved the previous seasons, at times I felt they dragged, especially season 1 with the 25 eps. The story feels more focused on all the characters opening up to one another , overcoming their insecurities and ships sailing. It’s angsty, emotional and full of wholesome moments. I feel like I got to watch these characters grow up right in front of me. 

One of the biggest criticisms you’ll hear about Kimi ni Todoke is the misunderstandings between characters and for the life of me I struggle to really understand the complaint. Are there things that could be resolved by the characters sitting down and having proper conversations? Yes. But that exists in real life too. It’s not always as simple as it sounds especially with teenage kids who are going through a very sensitive time in life and figuring things out. I will say that the misunderstandings that arise in season 3 don’t drag on too long and the way they’re resolved by the end is very satisfying and direct. That goes back to my earlier point about the kids truly growing up by the end of this. I could not help but feel proud at how the characters communicate and open up about their insecurities to one another. There’s so many vulnerable and tender moments that got me emotional.

Perhaps the biggest compliment about Kimi ni Todoke season 3 is that it genuinely feels like a Time Machine back into 2009. From the art style, designs, direction it feels like a perfect continuation of the story and I can’t thank Production IG enough for that. Most studios can’t even handle doing this for a show from a few years ago, nonetheless over a decade ago but they did it. They captured everything that makes this series special from the chibi faces, Ayane, Chizuru and Sawako’s banter and playful scenes, the cute bashful moments between characters.. even the seiyuus don’t sound like a day has past since 2009. I just couldn’t ask for more.

This is one of the shows that you pause and play dozens of times when watching because you just can’t help but squeal like a girl and cover your face from how cute it is. I love these characters to the moon and back and while this isn’t the full story, there’s some 40 more chapters left to go.. it’s at a spot where you’d feed comfortable leaving the anime. Everyone’s come into their own by the end of this season and while the individual relationships may have issues and struggle in the future, you feel that everyone is equipped to deal with it thanks to the experiences in this season.  

I had a blast watching this third season and it truly took me back to an era of anime I miss very dearly. The phrase “they don’t make anime like this no more” gets thrown around a lot these days, but it’s truly apt here. We truly don’t get these sort of shows where we fall in love with the cast and get to see them grow up in front of us over a long period of time. The landscape of the industry has changed, but for the 5 hour runtime of this show, it felt like we were back in the good old days. Thank you Production IG.

Kimi ni Todoke season 3 gets an extremely easy 10, out of 10."

56538,533098.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Kimi ni Todoke was my first school romance shoujo I watched when I was 17 and new to my anime journey, it instantly fell into my top 10 of all time for me, and at the age of 24, it hasn't changed. For years, I was hoping that we would get a continuation of the anime and I was slowly losing hope as the last season was in 2011. But boom, one day on Twitter it's finally announced! SEASON 3! The way I screamed, you don't even understand - FINALLY! I just finished watching season 3 and I'm so happy. The story picks things up fromthe previous season, but this time our favourite people, Sawako and Kazehaya, are now officially a couple! And we get to see how they navigate and get used to their new dynamic. It had ups and downs, and at times they can be a little corny, but overall, it was so heartwarming to see their love on screen, oh how I've truly missed them. And I couldn't have truly thought of a perfect ending on the last episode, OMG (no spoilers lmao). 
We also saw more development from Ryu and Chizuru, who are my favourite secondary couple. I loved how we got to learn more about their relationship and how much they have grown together, it made me appreciate them even more. I hope we'll get to see more of them in the future.
And last but not least, we got some more insight into Ayane and how she views herself and her relationships. Her unlikely bond with Kento was not something I was expecting, but it was truly beautiful and I loved their connection (again, no spoilers lol).
I felt that the story was more cohesive and was put together really well, and it didn't feel like certain situations and conflicts dragged on too long. As much as I loved season 2, the misunderstandings were hard to get through and went on for too long - which made it a little tedious to watch, even though the ending was worth it. I'm glad we had less of it this season though. Overall, I loved watching the story. I was worried about the season dropping on Netflix and even more worried when I saw only 5 episodes, but I believed it was fleshed out well within the hour time frame, you don't notice how time flies when you watch each episode and I love that given feeling.

One thing I'm glad they did was continue the original art style and animation, that was one of the things I fell in love with when I first watched the series, and they truly didn't disappoint in this season. They even brought back the original voice cast, and it brought back so many good memories and their performances were great. Most of the original and beautiful OST was used, with a sprinkle of some new ones, and a new OP. And I love it - it's so catchy and I did not once skip it! As well as the ending art for each episode! I wish we had an END song but it's okay, it's not that bothersome.

Each character in the show goes through personal growth and changes, whether it's in their relationships or their self. And I believe these were done well. Sawako's growth, especially, since the first season has been so satisfying to see. Seeing her grow and mature, and in the end, being more secure in herself and her relationship with Kazehaya. As well as seeing her be more secure in her friendships and her relationship with her parents is too cute, especially her dad, who's very protective of her lmao. Kazehaya is pretty much the same as Sawako and goes through his insecurities and worries about how he wants to treat Sawako, but I'm glad he confronts them, and with that, I'm excited to see what their relationship is gonna be like moving forward. Heck, I'm looking forward to the future of every character's relationships and dynamics.

There's no need to go over how much I enjoyed this - it should be obvious. The humour, the good moments, the sad moments, just everything was so enjoyable. I can't believe I've finished the new season already, I want more! I was smiling so damn much that my cheeks started to hurt. The blushing I did, the way I held my pillow to my face....everything was too cute for me to handle!

Overall, this was an amazing return for the series, and please, if you have never watched Kimi ni Todoke - please do! One of the best Shoujo's ever - I promise you, you'll fall in love with the series and the characters, just like I did all over again. And to my fellow old fans, don't miss out on this season! Thank you to the producers and author for listening to the fans and bringing back this beloved anime - I have more hope for a season 4 now and I'm looking forward to it!"
56538,533817.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"This season is everything I wanted from Kimi ni Todoke. The first two seasons are pretty good, but this season completely enraptured me. To me, the first two seasons were simply the prologue, and now the real story has finally begun. All the side characters get a spotlight, and honestly they are some of the best in the entire show. Ayane in particular solidified her spot as my favorite character, she was given a lot more depth and her inner conflict is super intriguing. The main couple finally gets to explore what being committed is like, and how to navigate that, which is always moreinteresting to me than the classic ""when will they confess"" rollercoaster. I love all the characters, I love seeing them navigate their problems, I love seeing them grow and bond and interact. The writing in this season/arc is simply enthralling, and I had tears in my eyes at multiple points. 

The art maintains its pretty, colorful, watercolor background style, and the new music added for the season is gorgeous, even better than the previous 2 seasons. The episodes being an hour long are also really satisfying, it allows you to get more immersed in the drama and the atmosphere, imo.  

All-in-all, I was so surprised by this season. If the next seasons keep up this momentum, this will be one of the best slice-of-life shows I've ever seen. I went right into this after watching the first two seasons, and I never expected to walk away from this show giving it a 10, but I will. And I did.

10/10"

Watching the first episode I was taken aback by how well each episode seamed together so smoothly. The art style resembles the original and improves on it as well. Each expression is captivated so beautifully. Watching the characters interact with one another brought me such joy. Every moment of the show had me reflecting the emotions that were displaying in front of me. I cried, I laughed, and I fell in love with each of the characters all over again."
56538,533045.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"So, I was a general guy who had watched Naruto and Black Clover thinking Shonen anime was good and blasting but incidentally I somehow got recommended and then after watching ""Kawai Hostel of Guide and Manners"" or ""Bakura wa minna kawaisou"" I believed that some good romance still is there waiting for me. I then stepped in the domain of Kimi ni todoke and all I can that it's magical in every aspect. I mean Sawa-san as I call her, she is so simple and she thinks so much and that's why I think she is considered as outcast by her class and then shefound Kazehaya who is her light bringing her to the domains of light where she can think (she should shine as she is such a sweet loving girl) and that's all I can say for Kimi ni todoke without spoiling much for people who still haven't seen this anime.


And after 13 years of wait, Netflix blessed us with the returning S3 of one of my favorite series 'Kimi ni todoke s3' and it was magical. First the production unit who had animation department did complete honor with the story and oh my the story was so so deep and I loved how such simple conversations can be so magical and so effective at times, When Sawa-san says something it is meant to be deep, can be simple but, deep. I think Sawa-san's beauty, simplicity makes this anime amazing.


Please give Kimi ni todoke a go. I request, you will not regret it. And, thank you Kimi ni todoke s3 for returning to me and bringing back the magic I felt like missing."
56538,533326.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"It was really great to see everyone again and get another season of this great story. I was not a super fan of the hour-long episode approach, but it was still nice to get the equivalent of 10 more episodes. It also gave me time to reflect on how much I've changed since I last watched this anime. The good points were still the good points. The characters are easy to root for and their are a lot of big ticket emotional moments throughout the season. Now that I'm older, there were some things that are meant to be seen as romantic that I justdidn't find romantic anymore, but I did appreciate that they were moments of growth for the characters none the less. 

I hope that we get to see some more episodes and finish the story. I know if we get more I'll definitely watch it. I really enjoy this anime even if I can see more flaws in it than I used to. 

If you liked the previous seasons, I think you'll like this season too."
56538,533033.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"this show is truly wonderful. it's heartwarming, funny and charming. the fact this has came back after over a decade in such a true to the original way with most of the original VA's is such a blessing to any fan of romance. the story is a bit more nuanced than other shoujo/romances but still is a high school shoujo so you know what to expect but where the difference lies is in the cast. I find them very interesting and fun to learn more about as the story progresses. In the 3rd season, we really get to dive deeper into each main characters history and motives. i ama big fan of the art of the series as it is not outstanding but just so fitting with its watercolor-esque hues to its downright meme able facial expressions and animation.

please give the entire series a chance it is worth the journey!"
56538,535549.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I was a big fan of the Kimi ni Todoke anime in the beginning, but my excitement dwindled as it progressed. However, I must say that the third season is one of the best pure romance seasons I've ever watched. The characters are realistic and well-written. Even though their flaws make them relatable, it can be tough to watch at times due to the realistic portrayal of romance. The series handles the conflict well with detailed explanations, and I'm hopeful that it will continue to receive more seasons and conclude every story as effectively as it did in season 3. In my opinion, it's astrong candidate for anime of the year and best romance anime of the year.

Overall Rating: 9/10"
56538,535998.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"(this is more of a personal review, just for my own logging) I was pretty astonished by this season! The slow, yet enjoyable pace of the first two seasons were pleasant. I know the ride I signed up for and had a great time doing so. We got plenty of developments this time around, and the episodes felt a little bit more like movies. So many things happened; twists and turns throughout the whole season, and the pay-off overall felt rewarding, deserved, and satisfying. The music - incredible. Art-style was, once again like previous seasons, soft, yet detailed. You can go from cute chibi style tosome artistic pieces that could serve well as legitimate pieces. AND they knew when to use them appropriately and tastefully! I found myself laughing plenty of times, feeling the emotions of the characters at others. It really captivated me and held my attention throughout. I wasn't expecting to be this satisfied with the third season (especially in hour-long episodes), but here we are. I love my girls and Kenta!!! (and Ayane especially she is cool)"
56538,534664.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"It's a shame to say I only started watching Kimi Ni Todoke after season 3 came out. I've always seen scenes of this anime on social media apps, but I just never gave it a try for some reason. I just know how happy all Kimi Ni Todoke og fans felt when season 3 came out, because what I just watched, is truly a masterpiece of an anime. Where do I even begin? Sawako being able to convey her feelings to everyone made me feel really happy inside. Let me mention, Sawako and I share the same MBTI personality; INFP. So, you can't comprehend howmuch watching Sawako made me emotional and it really hit me deep in my heart. I found myself crying and laughing at the same time throughout this entire anime. It was able to easily pierce through my heart and make me feel things I cannot explain.

 I'd be lying if I said it didn't make me feel lonely though! I often found myself dwelling on the thought that they all just seem to be having fun and having such closure with each other. Especially Kazehaya and Sawako. This is a bit personal, but I was reminded of my ex lover. It was quite the toxic relationship towards the end, and watching Kazehaya and Sawako just made me think to myself, how great amount of happiness would have occurred to me were I to date the right person? 

I felt rather envious of their relationship and Sawako's friendship with Chizu and Ayane. I want something like that. I think I could be greedy on this because I already have friends, but I don't think I have the same closure as much as Sawako does with her friends. I think this is what mainly makes me feel lonely. It's such an interesting thing how simply watching this anime can make you realize so many things about yourself. 

I got hooked on to Kimi Ni Todoke quite fast. I ended up also reading the manga till the end, and god I cannot explain to you guys how much I sobbed! To know such a masterpiece has come to an end! I know I'm the late watcher, and I wish I would have watched this way earlier. It easily climbed up to my top 5 anime. I've given all of you a peek into my personal life, but I just want to get this one more thing off my chest. After I have finished the anime and manga, I can't help but feel like I may not feel the same way Sawako felt towards someone. Because I don't think such people exist, at least I haven't met them. The thought of that does make me sad, but that's it. 

That was about all I wanted to say, and if you did read this far I genuinely thank you for spending your time doing so. This may be quite the odd review because I included my personal life in this, but I know this is what I wanted to say."
56538,534082.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Is this a review? Is this my ramblings while high? Did I enjoy this season? Yes. Yes to all. This season covers the arc where I dropped the manga 10 years ago. In manga form, to young ol' me, this was too much unnecessary drama for the sake of making the story longer. I gotta say, the medium added a lot in terms of watchability. In this instance, I was able to read the characters, what they were thinking, the stage of life they're going through, the type of people they are a lot more. It made it so much more enjoyable, it was cute. I re-watched the wholeshow during the pandemic, and season 2 is still the series' biggest blunder. I hope it'll remain that way if this gets another season."
56538,538049.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"10 years of waiting for a continuation and personally it was worth every year of waiting. Objectively the creative decisions that were made may not have been the best for the work. In my heart the season gets a 10, because seeing Sawako and company once again made me really happy. Reliving memories from 10 years ago and seeing where my life was then and how it is now was a good exercise in reflection and nostalgia. As for the story, the fact that Sawako and Kazehaya's relationship has developed on a secondary level is appreciated because it allows the secondary characters to have more screentime. Seeing the clumsy progress of Ryuu and Chizuru was something tender to see, as two teenagers try to cross that thin line from a friendship of years to a romantic relationship. The story arc of Ayane looking for a person who can love her, romantically, with the same intensity that her friends love her. Honestly, I think Ayane's development is the best of the season because it's not about being able to love someone else, but about loving yourself. As for the story, there aren't many complaints, and there's not much to criticize in this section.

Where there is something to criticize is the production decisions. I don't know who said that 1-hour episodes should be made, but please let him resign or get fired. One of the most criticizable points of the story is its slow pace. In 24-25 minute episodes you can enjoy the slow progress, in 1-hour episodes the story feels extremely heavy. So many things happen that at the end of an episode you forget what happened at the beginning and in the middle. Sometimes it generates the typical ""how much more is left?"" I understand that Netflix finds the one-hour format to be useful in other types of productions, but the audience that anime is aimed at is so ingrained in the 20-minute format that this feels too inorganic.

I hope they don't put the work on ice for another 10 years and then close it. It's good to revive this type of franchise to exploit nostalgia, but at least if you want to exploit it today, give it the treatment it deserves."
56538,535340.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Surprisingly enough, I was not as thrilled as I thought I would have been at the news of a new season for one of my most beloved manga adaptations... I refused to believe that a new season, made so many years after the original anime release could live up to the original. This one proved me wrong. The art style especially cought my eye!! You can really tell that they tried hard to recreate the old art style, and i think they did a great job!!! The nostalgic feeling I had while watching this new season brought so many memories of how wonderful the mangawas, and made me want to reach for it again!! Very grateful for this reminder of my love for Kimi ni todoke!!!"
54855,538438.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Senpai is an Otokonoko – In the age of emerging societal issues about sexuality, this show couldn’t have come at a better time to define the current age of the fragility known as the collective human society. And I’m all here for it. Cross-dressing and bisexuality are only some of the better-known terms when it comes to this sensitive topic that’s called sexual orientation. I’m sure that you’ve often heard terms like queer/LGBTQIA, homosexuality, and same-sex marriages all around given the rapid (and unfortunately rancid) age of the internet shoving and forcing ideals that regardless of your sexual orientation, we as humans should all be lovedone and the same, and that we should have our own ways to deal with anything that’s outside of the norm. Case in point, the very conservative Land of the Rising Sun that is Japan, experiencing yet another boom and resurgence of the known phenomena, especially within the 21st century. In the current day and age where people are more outspoken, the majority of which comes from the younger generation, they’re quite vocal in support over the years that same-sex relationships and marriage should be constituted into the National Diet (that is Japan’s government legislation), despite the ongoing views for and against LGBT rights that continue to this very day. And despite the awful and discriminative bigotry that is the Western view on LGBTQ+, Japan hasn’t had an issue with said term for decades now, which is seen throughout its culture, most especially in the AniManga industry where Yaoi and Yuri a.k.a Boys and Girls’ Love works are rampant, thereby creating an even deeper subculture of the infatuation of people who are sticklers to same-sex relationships and marriages to this day.

From the many Yaoi and Yuri works that are out and about in the AniManga industry, one such series stands out. And the surprising bit? It’s not even categorized as either genre. This is mangaka Pom’s Senpai wa Otokonoko a.k.a Senpai is an Otokonoko (or This is Him), a deconstruction of the LGBT genre, and simultaneously a coming-of-age story of accepting who you are regardless of gender norms, and its creation is quite the unique story of fascination. All of this was enough to win the hearts of its readers, thus increasing its popularity, as well as being well received by critics for its writing and characters, taking 3rd place in the web manga category of Kadokawa and Niconico’s Next Manga Award (of which its winner was mangaka Naoya Matsumoto’s Kaiju No. 8), as well as being Line Manga’s 3rd most read Webtoon series, all in 2021 alone.

Senpai wa Otokonoko: My Crossdressing Senpai tells the story of 2nd year student Makoto Hanaoka, a young man…who’s not really what he seems to be. His physique may be the fact that he’s a born-bred boy, but everything else is as otherwise. He’s best described as a tomgirl: someone who fancies the feminine side of things that girls often dress themselves with, to the point that he even wears his school’s standard female sailor uniform, despite from being shunned by everyone around him, to getting used to seeing him as such: a crossdressing boy. And that captures the attention of 1st year student Saki Aoi, who falls in love with him at first sight, thinking that he’s a girl, until the eventual reveal that he’s not, leaving her rejected. But she’s fine with whatever orientation he is anyway since she’s bisexual, being able to love both his heterosexual traits all the same in the hopes that she will become his first love, even though Makoto doesn’t reciprocate as much, even sometimes to the point of being judged by hanging out with a cross-dresser. And then there’s Ryuji Taiga, Makoto’s childhood friend who has been through the way with him since kindergarten, but his sexual orientation forces him to constantly question if he’s alright going all-in with the childhood friend-to-lovers trope, being that he’s secretly gay and in love with Makoto since their childhood days. This is quite the unusual love triangle as Makoto, Aoi, and Ryuji dig deep into their hearts into trying to understand and support each other as people who are unorthodox to their typical sexual orientations, and the drama in this anime does reveal a similar likeness of real-world discussions on what it means to be homosexual.

What started off as a manga draft for a lesbian romance, as both writer and illustrator, Pom had difficulties drawing male characters, and had to receive advice from an acquaintance on drawing a series where a boy dresses up as a girl, even if that meant that she was at times unhappy with her presentation of Makoto as a bona-fide boy. This is especially in Japanese high school culture where male students crossdress as female students and wearing the school’s female sailor uniforms does occur, though the school in her series is fictionalized and not based off of real-life high schools, down to the specifics. Pom also conceptualized the series in a way that instead of making a gag-based comedy (of which the manga, and now the anime, does have elements of it), she chose to tackle the theme of not obfuscating one’s sexuality when it comes to human relationships – the diversity of love and romance regardless of gender; being forward about liking feminine things as someone of the opposite sex and taking care of oneself. To note, however, this is NEVER the subject of litigation against people who try to defy gender norms, balancing the dark elements with lighter ones, and this is one of the key reasons why the mangaka herself kept the cast to as few characters as possible, stating her dissent when character-driven stories outpace the bigger picture of the actual story itself.

Regarding the love triangle that is Makoto, Aoi, and Ryuji, this is where the aesthetic of the series truly (and I mean TRULY) shines the brightest. Pom intentionally designed Makoto and Aoi to contrast against each other, with the former being constantly apprehensive and distressed, while the latter is assertive and poised, and Ryuji is the weighted balance within the two’s love life that got away but stood for the long run. You can tell that this unique trio of friends have a bond that’s like a balloon that no matter how much it inflates or deflates, it holds them altogether, but when it bursts, it bursts in a colossal way that it’s near to impossible to repair their close-knitted relationship. This is one of the reasons why Pom opted for visual storytelling rather than text-based storytelling as much as possible. The contrasts of Makoto liking the feminine side because of its aesthetic whilst being portrayed as a male in the inside; Aoi just being the typical high school student with a personality being that of a proactive and immature childish brat who always stays true to her values; and Ryuji just trying his best to counterbalance the insanity that is his childhood friend and the rejected heroine who loves them both the same (and even calling Ryuji her “Master”). This is a trio of characters planned to the precise detail, and Pom ultimately decides to “go where the others go” since there’s essentially no story to begin with, with her conceived characters being the ones to dictate the progress of the story itself, it’s all based on her experiences on the belief that they could not portray things believably unless she had experienced it herself, thus with each character having a part of the life and vision of the mangaka herself. And I mean, what can I say? This is a VERY well-thought-out plot, and characters designed for the intention to tell a story that’s larger than life itself, and I respect Pom for what she’s done here with this work that earned her the credibility and fame that is absolutely well deserved in the first place.

Running a tight ship like Senpai wa Otokonoko is a fine but ludicrous job, and having a subpar studio like Project No. 9 who’s doing 2 shows this season (this and the horrid animation presentation that is Naze Boku no Sekai wo Daremo Oboeteinai no ka? a.k.a Why Does Nobody Remember Me in This World?), both aspects will eventually crash and burn…but unexpectedly not for the former. With the backing of a big conglomerate like Aniplex, in-house director Shinsuke Yanagi and his staff team are undoubtedly blessed with a big budget to work with, being able to present the manga in anime form to a crisp, beautiful, and gorgeous display of both the gag comedy (which is taken off from the manga) and its world itself, which is just chef’s kiss. If anything, this anime is one of the best produced shows this Summer season, and I’m not exaggerating when Sakuga this fluid (even in a minimalistic way) is a treat for the eyes.

The OST also is really good and provides the deep and rich atmospheres, that’s all thanks to veteran music composer Yukari Hashimoto, having done prior high-profile series the likes of 3-gatsu no Lion a.k.a March Comes in Like a Lion and more recently with Komi-san wa, Comyushou desu. a.k.a Komi Can't Communicate, and this Winter's Yubisaki to Renren a.k.a A Sign of Affection. But if there's just one complaint, the OP and ED songs from Kujira are hit and miss, even if the ED (feat. Nishina) displays lighthearted feelings. It's decent, but forgettable.

Senpai wa Otokonoko a.k.a Senpai is an Otokonoko is a show that you CANNOT just enter into blindly because of its subject theme, thinking that you'll understand the motivations of the characters, and even far down to their personalities and such. This is NOT a show for the easily offended, and it takes a whole deal of maturity to put yourself in the shoes of a fellow LGBT who's been harassed, assaulted, or even judged to the point of hate, having to deal with feelings that are so far out of the typical straight human, and that's not an easy feeling for the Makotos, Aois and Ryujis in our fragile human society to overcome the constant plaguing issues of discrimination.

However, with that said, the anime, in my opinion, is one of the best shows of the Summer 2024 season, and all it takes is the heart of sympathy and understanding to see from their POV, then you can be guaranteed that Senpai wa Otokonoko is more than just a great show. It's a story about what we can do as the collective human society to help these people get along in this defecting, cancel culture of an egregious, sensitive society, to embrace and love them one and the same, regardless of who and what they are. It's a story about love and acceptance, and I'm glad to see that light and be better at treating people all the more."
54855,538650.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Senpai wa Otokonoko is an anime that steps into delicate territory with a potentially impactful story but ultimately plays it far too safe. At its core, the show revolves around themes of identity, self acceptance, and navigating the complexities of personal relationships, especially those involving gender nonconformity. The setup promises meaningful exploration, but time and again, it pulls back just before things get real. This consistent hesitance gives the entire narrative a ""sanitized"" feel, like it’s afraid to truly engage with the difficult topics it skirts. The show touches on serious issues, strained family dynamics, the pressure of societal expectations, and the bittersweet nature of unrequitedlove, but it only ever brushes against them. Every time it seems poised to dive deeper, it retreats to an almost utopian status quo where everyone is perfectly accepting, and conflicts resolve themselves without any real confrontation. While this can be refreshing in certain contexts, it feels out of place here, given the weight of what’s being dealt with.

Makoto Hanaoka, the crossdressing protagonist, is a prime example of this. There’s a clear struggle within him, exacerbated by the conflicting attitudes of his parents, yet the story avoids digging into the psychological impact of such a situation. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the dynamic between him and his mother. Throughout the show, their relationship is marked by tension and misunderstanding, but when the time comes for a resolution, it feels completely unearned. The abruptness of this shift robs the moment of emotional weight, making it seem more like a narrative shortcut than a meaningful breakthrough. The narrative implies tension but never follows through on it, preferring to wrap things up in a neat bow. It’s a pattern repeated throughout, whether in Makoto's aforementioned family dynamics, his interactions at school or his evolving relationships with other characters. Despite some promising moments, the show's reluctance to explore these tensions undermines the emotional resonance it could have achieved.

This avoidance is also noticeable in the romantic arcs. One character’s feelings of unrequited love are portrayed in a way that seems on the verge of poignancy, yet rather than grappling with the complex emotions involved, the show opts for an easy reset. It goes back to a comfortable status quo, avoiding the messier but more honest aftermath that love often brings. It’s as if the show is afraid of its characters truly growing or facing the reality of their circumstances.

The same issue can be seen with Saki Aoi, whose backstory had the potential to dive into the emotional intricacies of forgiveness, resentment, and the yearning for familial connection, but the show’s desire to maintain a light, sanitized tone keeps it from fully realizing this potential. Instead of allowing the characters to confront and process these issues, the narrative opts for a simplistic resolution where everyone moves on without confronting the lingering scars of the past.

Despite this, Saki remains a compelling character. Her bright, optimistic exterior contrasts with the unresolved emotional baggage she carries, making her one of the more layered individuals in the story. However, as with many aspects of this show, the narrative’s reluctance to address these layers in a meaningful way leaves the story feeling incomplete. The show hints at deeper emotional truths but consistently pulls back before fully exploring them.

What’s frustrating about this title is that it frequently teases the audience with the potential for more. It’s not that the show is devoid of substance, but rather that it continually undermines itself by refusing to follow through on its more difficult themes. There’s a strong message about self acceptance and coming to terms with one's identity, but the insistence on avoiding discomfort drains it of impact. The result is a narrative that feels polished on the surface, but hollow underneath.

In the end, this anime isn’t a bad watch, but it’s hard not to feel disappointed by what could have been. It presents a world where tough conversations and emotional growth are hinted at but never fully embraced. While it offers moments of sweetness and warmth, the reluctance to tackle its core themes with the seriousness they deserve leaves it feeling like a missed opportunity."
54855,538439.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Being true to yourself is the most important thing in life. No matter what happens, you’re the only person you have to live with everyday for the rest of your life, so you better make sure you love the person in the mirror. Painoko is one of the most respectful and mature depictions of teenagers dealing with gender dysphoria and sexual identity I’ve seen. Unlike other stories in this medium, it’s not something played up for laughs or for entertainment, but an actual part of Makoto and Ryuji’s identities that they struggle with. While it’s not without flaws, on the whole painoko is a verycompetently written story depicting extremely relevant issues for young adults and a must watch for any LGBTQ fan, or just those who want to learn more about what goes through crossdressers’ heads. Thoroughly enjoyed this even as someone who wasn’t really interested in that sort of thing coming in.

Liking “cute” and “girly” things doesn’t make you less of a boy. You can enjoy whatever you want as whatever gender you want. It’s all made up social roles that society tries to box us into anyway. Painoko is great because it wants to drive this message home to people by showing Makoto coming to terms with who they are. Initially we see Makoto struggling with their “girly” tendencies while society views them as a boy, before eventually realising you don’t have to box yourself into either gender. As someone who likes things that society traditionally associates with girls, I really related to Makoto in this one. While I don’t have the crossdressing desire, I do empathise with wanting to just enjoy things and be myself in a way that society unfortunately looks down on me for. Fortunately at my age, it’s not as big a deal as it would be for a younger person. I’ve become very comfortable with myself, but I think this show has some nice lessons and offers encouragement for younger people who may still be struggling with accepting who they are. Again, the author clearly understands this and doesn’t use it as a simple plot device, this is very much a part of Makoto’s character and something they grapple with throughout the show. Even when they start to accept themselves, there’s the conflict with Makoto’s mother..

Normally in these situations, the mother is the more accepting one, but Painoko has a unique set up in which the dad is actually more understanding of Makoto’s gender dysphoria and crossdressing than their mom! Instead of accepting her child and encouraging them to be themselves, she belittles and is emotionally abusive to them. Honestly it was hard to watch, but it is sadly something that many people irl go through so I think it’s important to see it depicted. Also, like most people irl realise, that abuse comes from someone who themselves has a lot of deep rooted trauma. Hurt people hurt people as the expression goes. 

Now, while Makoto crossdressing and struggling with their identity is a big part of the show, there’s also the Ryuji situation that I loved. Ryuji throughout the show struggles with his sexuality. He’s been in love with Makoto since they were kids and loves Makoto not because they dress like a girl, but just for the person they are. Makoto deals with this guilt wherein they feel like they’ve tricked Ryuji into liking them because they dress like a girl and Ryuji feels bad for falling in love with someone that society perceives as a guy. It’s a complicated and delicate situation that we see both struggle with over the series. Honestly it was hard to hear Ryuji put himself down constantly and lament over his sexuality throughout the series. It is again a sad, but often far too real experience that many people go through. The author does a good job of getting across just how dangerous falling into that mentality can be and how important it is to realise there’s nothing wrong with you and you can’t help who you’re attracted to. My only issue with this particular situation is I feel the Ryuji and Makoto relationship dynamic was handled poorly in the last couple episodes. There’s a big turning point that occurs and kind of gets brushed under the carpet because of third cast member’s drama. 

Another big plus for this story is how everyone communicates and doesn’t drag things out. I really can’t emphasise enough how much I appreciate this. There’s no drawn out drama and when there are misunderstandings, the characters have mature sit down conversations within an episode max. Like it was genuinely such a breath of fresh air to hear people apologise, say what’s on their mind, confess and accept responsibility for their actions! Just as a brief example, there was a situation with Ryuji and Makoto due to those insecurities we talked about earlier, and instead of it being some long process, Ryuji instantly apologises and explains why he acted the way he did and why he felt a certain way. My jaw was damn near on the floor. The author really gets people and it shines through in the writing!

The love triangle in the story I think is probably one of the weaker aspects. For me, the big appeal here is the gender and sexual identity stuff. I felt like Makoto and Ryuji were the only real ship and that Aoi was frankly there as comic relief. Yes, she got a serious arc in the final third, but honestly I just didn’t care about her that much and I definitely didn’t see her as an actual potential partner for Makoto. She always felt to me like a really good friend or even little sister like figure. Going to sound a little mean to say too, but I was kind of happy when she was out of the picture and dealing with her own family drama so the other two could get closer..

Production wise it’s a solid seasonal. Nothing crazy, but the art style is cute and character designs really good. The animation is passable, nothing crazy, but not bad at all. The seiyuu performances bring this story to life though. There’s so many big emotional moments in this one that they convey their feelings thru the screen for, especially Aoi’s arc with her mom and Makoto and Ryuji’s arc in the final few eps. Hats off to them!

So, my verdict is that Painoko is a must watch. I had it in my top 10 new anime of summer video and that really has stayed the same. It’s been solidly in my top 4-5 shows of the season throughout and one of the best times of the week for me. I absolutely loved Makoto and related so much to the desire to enjoy “girly”  things in peace. It’s no fair that the girls get all the fun! While I didn’t initially have an interest in crossdressing or even BL stories prior to this, I had my eyes opened and worldview expanded and now am really interested in reading and learning more. I feel that I have grown more interested in LGBTQ issues as a whole thanks to this series and that’s a testament to the job the author did with it. Bravo.

Painoko gets 9 out of 10."

54855,538556.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"I initially started this anime because part of its premise reminded me of Hourou Musuko, a 2011 coming of age and romance anime about two transgender protagonists. But as it turns out the main character in here later on does not see themselves as either a boy or a girl, so I guess we’re talking about a non-gender conforming non-binary protagonist here instead. I mean this anime still shares some things with that one, such as the main character dressing with feminine clothes half the time and being initially rejected by most people around, and having a supportive parent while the other does not accept them,but they have nothing in common beyond that and their approach are vastly different.

The romance part of the anime is peculiar, as the protagonist is part of a sort of a love triangle with both a boy and a girl, having the male character being conflicted by his feelings and afraid of being homo or at least bisexual, and of being seen as a creep, both by his friend and society. The female character has no issue with the main character’s identity but her feelings end up being different from what it’s initially shown.

Thus despite being a romance, the approach in here seems like an anti-genre sort of thing, as the characters go in and out of relationships without actually being in love with the others and instead being afraid of losing their bonds, and desperately want affection that was neglected to them at some point in their lives. 

So, it’s the anime like KareKano? Which took the premise of a high school romance between two seemingly perfect characters to explore their real selves and their psyche behind them? Not really, hardly, as the series is mostly comical and leaves its themes in the background for the sake of focusing on something else, and when it does focus on them, it feels like a surface level of exploration.

KareKano was a comedy as well but it knew when and how to separate its humor from its psychological introspection, while this show only has the character feeling kinda sad yet doesn’t miss the chance to throw some jokes every few minutes.

Aside of the messy tone, another issue is that, despite its peculiar love triangle and themes it wants to explore, the execution still comes down to awkward teenagers being unable to resolve most things just by talking them out, which is why the resolutions of every conflict there is end up being very easygoing:
 
-The main character is bullied lightly only in the past on another school, and rejected just at the beginning of the story, they quickly become popular and supported by everyone in the school.

-Ryuji and Makoto’s relationship and conflicts get two episodes tops of focus. Exactly because there isn’t much content to explore about that, at least not in this anime.

-Related to that, characters faking their feelings does not lead to any interesting change in dynamics or a major conflict between them, as they are still around the others and keep accepting each other no problem.

-Aoi’s loneliness does get some focus throughout several episodes, but that can and is in fact resolved simply by having the other two mains around. And the most important part of that aspect, the absence of her mother, gets resolved extremely easily and in an easygoing and very lighthearted way by the end of the series.

-Want to talk about the thing between Makoto and their mother? It gets completely sidelined until the very end of the series, it is looked deeper only when the show is about to end, and just like with Aoi, for how big it seemed to be, the resolution leaves a lot to be desired.

Plus the adaptation isn’t even complete as there is a movie coming out next year to adapt the final bunch of chapters of the source material.

Apparently, the anime covered the whole source material by rushing through all of its content in just one season, so that could be part of the problem, but that does not change the end result of the adaptation.

I can’t even say that the aesthetics are remarkable in any particular way, the backgrounds and artwork are good, the special effects and character designs are one of the same you can find anywhere else. The main issue is the chibi art style the series goes for half the time, which negatively affects everything else.

Just like with Human Bug Daigaku, which I reviewed recently, I appreciate how this show properly captured the main aesthetic of its source material, but by itself it kind of sucks. For the comical moments, the style feels tryhard, and when it is used in between more serious scenes, it ruins the mood completely.

And that goes for the sound as well. The main character having a clear male voice is a nice touch, but everyone else sounds very typical, except for Aoi, who has a weirdly raspy or something like that voice and sounds unnatural a lot of the times to me. The opening and ending are cute and fitting but the rest of the music, as well as the sound effects, are mostly unremarkable. 

So, if you’re up for a romance series with a somewhat unusual love triangle with some LGBTQ+ themes thrown in there, and with an attempt at exploring some more serious stuff to make it dramatic enough to feel like something might happens, while still having wholesome resolutions for you to not feel bad while watching it, this is your show. If otherwise you want an actual serious and more complex look into any of its themes, I think you should try somewhere else.

54855,538473.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"*Spoiler-free section.* I took Senpai wa Otokonoko off of the metaphorical shelf because I had a free slot in my seasonal anime, and the title sounded interesting. It was pretty far down on the seasonal popularity list, so I expected to find an alright show I could at least enjoy my time with. What I wasn’t expecting was a show that carefully, respectfully, and tactfully portrayed topics such as, LGBTQ people, gender non-conformity, and various forms of child abuse. Senpai wa Otokonoko isn’t a new favorite of mine, but I really respect and like the way that it handled its characters, story, and themes. Along withvery good animation, music, and VA work, this anime has become one of my favorites this season. 9/10

*Spoilers beyond this point.*

Senpai wa Otokonoko has three main stories. Makoto, Saki, and Ryuugi, and all of their arcs are a coming-of-age story about being yourself. The anime starts as a simple Party A falls For Party B, but then Party C discovers their feelings for Party A. Is this generalized plot entirely unique to this show? No, because many anime follow this format for their stories, so, this show does lean on the LGBTQ and gender non-conformity point a bit to make the story unique. However, the story quickly becomes more complicated. Party A can’t express themselves because of an abusive parent. Party B is abandoned and neglected. I believe that a secondary theme of this anime is breaking the cycle of hurt. Makoto and Saki are very kind, friendly, and caring people. All of these are qualities their homes lack. I also like how Makoto is a deep character and is not a typical objectified anime femboy archetype.

One of the reasons that Makoto is more than just that archetype is because he comes from a pretty difficult living situation. You see, his mother is, no exaggeration, obsessed with him being gender-conforming. So obsessed in fact that Makoto keeps all of his cute/girly outfits and objects in a locker in a storage shed on school grounds. Well, that just seems like a controlling parent right? Well, that’s not all because Makoto brings Saki over to his house. She meets his mom, and she acts like a normal person. However, a few days later she finds a pink handkerchief in Makoto’s room. Instead of assuming that the handkerchief is his friend’s who was over a couple of days ago, she assumes it’s his. She then sits at the dining table, for an unknown period of time, with all of the lights off except for one, literally STARING at this pink handkerchief like a lunatic. Later, Makoto tries to tell her that he wants to control when he gets his hair cut instead of her telling him to. She then begins to breathe heavily and has to be left in a separate room to “recover.” Poor baby. What is interesting is that his dad isn’t in absentia. He drives Makoto around while they talk about his gender identity. His dad basically asks if he wants to transition into a girl, or just likes dressing as one. Later, we see that his answer is neither. He wants to be himself. His dad seems at least passively supportive, and that’s better than what his mother offers. He also gives Makoto his grandfather's address and tells him to go and make a visit. His grandfather enjoys more feminine things, so obviously he is supportive and understanding of Makoto.

Saki also comes from a difficult living situation. Being neglected by her father and abandoned by her mother for 10 years isn’t just something brought up once or twice to explain why her parents aren’t around when her friends come over, or why she lives alone with her grandmother. She is genuinely affected by her parents being bad people, and it’s shown through her actions. She craves love and attention from others. When she was younger, she tried to be friends with everyone, but that freaked some of the other kids out, and then they distanced themselves from her. In high school, she is friends with quite a few people, but now is looking for someone to be her “special someone” to make her feel happy. She is trying to fill the hole left by her abusive parents. On a side note, I do not trust her mother trying to come back into Saki’s life. 

On the note of her parents, Saki’s dad loves his whale-studying job more than her, therefore, she learns a lot about whales just to try and make him pay attention to her, she texts him all the time even though he never answers her, and the only reason he comes back into town is when his mother is in the hospital after becoming light-headed and falling. After that visit, he leaves right for the whales again. He didn’t even realize that she was wearing a large band-aid on her knee. Her mother is no better. She walked out on Saki when she was little. Leaving her with an absent father and an aging grandmother. To me, there is no wonder that Saki is the way she is, and why she feels the way she feels.

Ryuuji doesn’t come from an immediately hostile environment like the other two mains, as a matter of fact, his little sister seems to know, and support, that he has a crush on Makoto. Now, this does not mean that his story is any less interesting. He starts the story by being friends with Makoto, and, with Saki’s help, he realizes his feelings for him. His feelings are shown in a, mostly, realistic and sympathetic way, and anyone who has developed feelings for a good friend would agree with me.

Everyone’s VA work is good, but the standout is Saki’s. She brings a type of excited, goofy, funny energy, but she can also be serious and nervous when she needs to be. The animation is great too. I’m not a huge fan of the art style drastically switching to simple and chibi-like art style for the funny parts. It pulls me out of the story a bit and makes me think that the creator wanted there to be a clear switch between the serious parts and the funny parts. As if they can’t coexist. 

I have other small problems with the anime too. First of all, Makoto gave up on dressing like a girl, throwing away all of his cute stuff, and then getting over giving up on all of that stuff is done fairly quickly. I wanted to see more of his mental struggle. Secondly, Ryuuji doesn’t seem to struggle too much with his newfound sexual understanding. In the beginning, he was like “No, I don’t like Makoto” to, “No, I don’t like Makoto, but what if?” to, “Yes, I do like Makoto.” It was too straightforward for my liking. Thirdly, I would have liked to see more of Makoto’s current school situation. We see a few students acting weird around him in the first episode, but after that, everyone treats him no differently than anyone else. Also, most of the school problems we see are flashbacks to his first year. Also, I think that the first few episodes don’t set the tone for the rest of the show. I think that they come off as more like “A mostly unserious comedy about how this guy dresses like a girl.” Finally, I don’t like how the abusive moms are going through a type of redemption arc. Listen, it’s not like bad people can’t be redeemed, but these two are really bad people and I just don’t buy it. 

Is Senpai wa Otokonoko the best show ever? Did it make it into my top 10? 20? No, no, and no. But, what this show IS is a well-done look into what life can be like if you identify as an LGBTQ person, a gender non-conforming person, and/or a person that has suffered one of, if not various forms of, child abuse. This show is tragic, comedic, thoughtful, and great all around. The characters and story get a 9.5, and the enjoyment, sound, and animation all get a 9. I can’t believe that a show I originally pegged down as a mid-7 was able to become a low 9. Quite the surprise, and what is even more of a surprise is that this show is my second favorite this season. 9/10.

54855,539045.0,6.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"A very interesting premise but one that didn't have the necessary space to develop. A simple premise, a boy who likes to dress as a girl and pretty things. This will lead to an identity crisis and family problems, which would be the driving force of the story. Unfortunately, the story explored this theme halfway and in a very superficial way. The first 3 chapters are a bait where they give you a little of what you came to look for, but the rest of the story is divided into 3 subplots. The friend in love with the protagonist who denies the idea that he couldlike men, the cheerful and energetic girl with family problems and the story of our protagonist begins to develop in a secondary plane. The whole season I saw it more like a Turkish soap opera, since there were many subplots with high doses of drama and exaggerations to lengthen the plot just enough to announce a movie that closes the story.

What is most disappointing is that the protagonist's story becomes blurred during 6 episodes, because space has to be given to the other two stories. Honestly, those stories weren't bad but it's not what one came looking for. The girl's family problems have already been seen in many other media and the boy, although it works for the ""romantic"" factor that they want to give to the story, it doesn't feel right that they force a relationship when the protagonist is still lost in his life decisions. In the final stretch, the same story remembers who its protagonist was and tries to rush the pace so that everything is centered on Makoto again. Unfortunately, it doesn't end up having cohesion, since in the end everything is resolved with the power of family, love and friends but without really facing the reasons for the rejection that our protagonist suffered at the beginning.

If you just want to watch a soap opera, here you will find them and you may become a little fond of the characters. If you're looking for a story of acceptance and self-love while trying to fight against society's prejudices, there's none of that here. What's more, they're going to try to sell you the idea that society has never made a negative judgment of that magnitude."

The thrut it's, i'm very identified with Makoto and the autoexploring of his autoperception. This anime gave me a powerful message: ""If you manage to let go of certain important things, you can at least protect one thing, whatever it may be"". I grow up being a boy, but in my life i usually like girl's things, like clothes, make-up and cute things, but live in a sexist society in third world make the things very hard and i had tolet it go that tastes.

But this anime made me realize what doesn't matter, you have to live a happy life being who really are.

Friends, family and other persons opinion doesn't matter when you know who you are and you want to live happy.

This anime for me gave me the courage for search for what really i am, ""a boy who like, look like a girl with a cute things"".

The genders are just genders, the things doesn't have gender, so live how you want even if the society thinks you are weird.

However what truly boosted this score up too a 9 was the final 12 episode like being totally serious i have never seen an anime conclude that good before it is sucha good ending and the whole show is worth watching just for the episode (no spoilers).

The story is quite unique and offers a fresh perspective. While there are some predictable moments, I still enjoyed it because I appreciate this genre and setup. The art style is fitting for the story, complementing the narrative well and enhancing the overall viewing experience. The characters are well-rounded with both strengths and flaws, making themrelatable and engaging. They are not portrayed as unusually strong, smart, or stupid, which adds to their realism. Additionally, the characters react to situations and events in a realistic way, which adds depth to the story and makes it more believable.

54855,538729.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"In a season filled with romance anime, this was easily the best. In lesser hands, Makoto's titular cross-dressing could have been treated as a cheap gimmick, but fortunately this gentle romantic drama respects its characters and has a strong story to tell. Makoto dresses as a girl at school, but hides it from his mother, fearing how she will react. He hasn't reconciled how he perceives himself or how he wants to live his life, and this causes tension with those around him. Saki develops an obsessive crush on Makoto, which brings her into conflict with his fiercely protective best friend Ryuiji. The early setupis something that could have been spun out for surface-level romcom antics ad infinitum, but instead serves as a diving board for a deeper exploration of these three characters, their individual struggles to understand and accept themselves, the lengths they go to in attempts to avoid hurting each other, and the pressures they face from their families and friends.

With the exception of one late standalone episode that throws in another character, the show avoids the frequent single-cour anime pitfall of going off on tangents, instead remaining focused on its central trio. It covers a surprising amount of ground in developing these characters. While it doesn't resolve every plot thread in its 12 episodes, it picks its battles and has a mostly satisfying, self-contained arc. Fortunately a sequel movie has already been announced, which will presumably tie up the remaining elements that the TV series leaves hanging."

It would have felt like a missed opportunity if it had stopped at just cross-dressing and cute, pinkish aesthetics without delving into the deeper discussion of gender and sexuality. Unfortunately, other subjects took up some time (which wasn’t the issue).

Similarly, it oftenfelt like we were jumping around from different plot points constantly and some things that felt like they should have had more impact to them were brushed over to get to the next thing.

54855,538627.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"I want to preface this review by saying that Senpai wa Otokonoko is one of my favorite manga of all time. I am writing this review from a fan of the source material's perspective. With this being said, I did enjoy watching this anime; however, it left much to be desired. While not a standalone bad watch by any means, I don't believe it to be a very good adaptation of the source material. TL;DR: really, really great series, but pretty lackluster execution in this adaptation. My complaints lie within two key points: visuals and pacing. Let's talk about the visuals first. I believe the characterdesigns were adapted well into the animation, and everyone looks very cute, but regarding ""animation"", there isn't very much of that to begin with. At many points it felt like I was just rereading the manga but with sounds and voice acting. Most of the actual animated sections were drawn in a sort of simple chibi style that Pom-sensei uses throughout the manga, and I found it to be quite endearing and enjoyable especially for comedic moments in the manga, but quite overused and distracting here in the anime. They especially take away from some of the more serious moments where Pom tends to refrain from using them, but are used very liberally in the anime. A lot of the rest of the scenes are depicted via slideshow montages of still images or otherwise very minimal animation. On top of this, many background characters are drawn without eyes, which I do understand as a way to make the backgrounds easier to draw, but the fact that they often remain eyeless even when attention is drawn to them is very off-putting. All this aside though, in general, none of the standalone visuals look bad at all, and Pom's lovely art style was adapted very nicely. Unfortunately, it's clear the show wasn't given a very high budget, and it definitely reflects in how it's presented visually.

Now, pacing. This 12 episode anime covers around 75% of the manga, which is 100 chapters long. This makes for a lot of things to be gone through too fast, or just plain skipped over in some cases. I imagine that as an anime viewer unfamiliar with the source material, this wouldn't be as much as of an issue; however, from a manga reader's perspective, it personally felt very weird to watch sometimes. Some important arcs in the manga felt very rushed through here, and some less important ones felt like they were given too much attention, which left me very confused sometimes. At no point during watching this did I have any idea where they were gonna end it off. And again, this is only really an issue from a manga reader's perspective, so take this paragraph with a grain of salt.

Now, as I am a big fan of Senpai wa Otokonoko as a manga, I have to talk about some of the positives of this anime adaptation. As I mentioned before, the character designs and Pom's art style were adapted into the anime very nicely. Along with that, all of the voice casting for this adaptation fits each character super well; they're all almost exactly how I imagined them sounding in my head when I was reading. The voice acting isn't all that's good in regards to sound either; The opening and ending and all the OST in between are very good and help tie scenes together very nicely. I'm also very grateful that much of the LGBTQ+ theming was given the attention it deserves, as it's very important to the series as a whole and a big reason why I personally fell in love with it.

To conclude, I will answer the main big burning question: do I recommend this anime, or do I not? The answer is it depends. I do not want to deter anyone from experiencing a series as beautiful and lovely as Senpai wa Otokonoko. If you're not someone who reads any manga at all, then I won't discourage you from watching the anime; by all means, go ahead! As mentioned above, if you're not a fan of the source material, much of the things I mentioned will not sour the experience for you. However, if you're someone who does read manga and happened to stumble upon this anime, I would definitely suggest trying to read the manga first instead. Overall, yes, I do recommend Senpai wa Otokonoko wholeheartedly. There is just simply, in my opinion, a much better way to experience it than via this anime adaptation."

Awful pacing, a fudged narrative, and overall bad decisions on what to develop, to include or exclude, played the key roles in destroying good potential. Absent logic in the writing department strikes again. The anime often felt like three different seasons mixed into one, and nothing got the time it deserved. The whole ""muh parents"" arc and the ""old friends from school appear, at the second last episode, bringing with them flashbacks, and a focus on people no one cares about"" delivered the kill shot. Let'sbe fair, no law or rule written anywhere requires that a webtoon artist should know about dramatic technique or poetics. Just the intention to create something justifies the endeavor, and nothing wrong with that.

Fans of the franchise will appreciate the sheer scale and power on display, as well as the attention to detail in character designs and settings. As a long-time fan of Overlord, I found myself deeply engaged with how the movie captured the essence of the series, particularly through its dramatic confrontations and strategic nuances. However, the pacingin the first half did feel somewhat rushed, with transitions that, at times, resembled a powerpoint slideshow, moving rapidly from one scene to the next without allowing enough room for certain moments to fully breathe. 

While the movie is enjoyable in its own right, readers of the light novels such as myself may notice several omitted or condensed details, which leave parts of the story feeling a bit flat. Given the challenge of adapting two volumes into a two-hour film, this was somewhat expected.

Score: 10/10 – A visually impressive and immersive experience, despite some pacing issues.

Glory to the 41"
48896,537953.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Well, Overlord has returned and returned in full glory, again. Just better than ever, as movie budget allowed creators to do technical shaenigans TV show was not really able to pull off. But let's go back to beginning, initial idea of cutting Sacred Kingdom arc wasn't, in my opinion, the best. Whole structure of it fits ideally in the middle of Overlord IV, or rather should. But as we all know creators did good job adapting volumes 10,11 and 14 into season 4 without undermining importance of said arc. Volumes 12 and 13 of the novel were left out and one of my favourite (andpossibly majority of WN and LN fans) arcs had became a movie. And it was done brilliantly. 

Reason why Demiurge wasn't much of a character in Overlord IV was because he was in the Sacred Kingdom as demon Jaldabaoth with his army of monsters. Now, the whole thing does few great things actively walking between what happened in Overlord 4 and the events of the movie itself. Especially managing between some reworked scenes to fit the storyline and what is happening at what point of the 4th season (the whole thing is taking place simultaneously with the events of the Overlord IV). And, oh boy, this movie is bonkers. I grew more chest hair just by watching it. It also is best adapted novel to anime in the series, 135 minutes runtime helped great deal, even with usual cuts. 

But let's focus a bit on technical stuff, it is definitely best looking Overlord to date. Both 2D and CGI styles are buffed and on speed, animators outdid themselves here by miles compared to seasons 1-3 (I believe season IV is a massive step up technically). The planning, stills and backgrounds are smooth and rarely eyesore, which is a big upgrade too as sometimes in the show differences between movements and stills were way too visible. Animation itself is smooth af, general animation style is sharper and consistent. Choreography is peaked this time, battle scenes (final one!!!) perfectly executed and pumped enough adrenaline to sit in the edge, the fights choreography also amazing, especially between our main characters when Ainz steps in to do his usual fuckery. 

Sound design is also nicely upped here, with bigger budget mix itself sound more full and whole experience was much more immersive. As of the music itself it's the usual stuff, bombastic epicness destroying cinemas speakers perfectly blending with the action on the screen. Sound mix itself is stead and very much delivers what it supposed to: maximum enjoyment. 

Now, from the writing point of view there were few cuts, some could say few too many, can agree with that myself. Unfortunately 2 volumes squeezed in 7 episodes runtime requires some, but it wasn't nearly as bas as I expected, it wasn't bad at all, most of the things that were cut out not going to be massively missed and if anything only for LN readers. It's bit more serious and definitely much more violent. Sacred Kingdom arc on its own is very violent. I'd say the writing itself is the biggest up for me rather than a con as it perfectly blends with Overlord IV, especially at the end. Both LN and anime fans should be more than satisfied and happy. I was. 

To sum this bit of a review in a few sentences:
It's the best Overlord to date, definitely justified cutting the events from the 4th season to present it to us as a movie. Bigger budget, bigger team, bigger everything, bombastic experience. As it should be. Obviously watching it without watching prequels is pointless, it also should be watched AFTER watching Overlord IV, the experience will be much better and will reduce confusion. But I doubt anyone will watch it at this point without watching rest of the show. It's more violent, more intensive and incredibly paced, it sounds better and definitely looks better. Perfectly balanced between LN and anime, for once. 

All hail Ainz Ooal Gown! All hail Overlord!

KINO."
48896,537799.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"The film was made in the Overlord style so many love, it feels satisfying to watch the way the story is told and even the animation was good. Any fears that the film may had been rushed were unjustified, the love put into this project can be felt while watching it. It is probably one of the best films I have seen so far, it definitely is a worthy addition to the Overlord franchise. LN readers may miss a few scenes, but considering how few screentime the studios had to work with, the result is still amazing. While some moments may feel very fast paced,they also convey the feeling of Overlords regular fast pace, and so it is a good experience. I recommend this film to anyone who liked the previous seasons or manga."
48896,537845.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"This film is very good in terms of animation and CG when compared to the anime version, especially the first two seasons that made my eyes sore. In terms of the story, those of you who have never watched the animation or read the novel might be confused, so I feel that the core of this film can only be enjoyed after you watch the animation, read the novel or at least watch a YouTube video that discusses a little about the world in Overlord so you can imagine what really happened (If you are Indonesian you could watch Megane Sensei for a better understanding).And the fight scenes presented feel very good with lasers and great combination of colors even though they are still under Frieren, which shows that Mad House can still cook seriously (I hope the animator get enough sleep and well paid).

Of course, there are some scenes in the novel that are cut or there are scenes that I think are less important, but I am quite satisfied with the content of the story that does not seem rushed considering that this film summarizes two novels. If we talk about shortcomings, there are two things that annoy me about this film. The first is the final battle scene between Ainz and Jaldabaoth which ends with a scene that doesn't feel as grand as their initial fight. And secondly, what really annoys me is because I didn't get the free Overlord novel that was distributed after watching it in the cinema even though I really wanted it."
53128,539428.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Atri: My Dear Moments – Can humans and robots ever find kinship amongst one another, let alone be accepted by the masses for whom the latter really are, given their history? Oh, the glorious days of visual novels…that without fail, NEVER seem to translate well to the anime spectrum, in one way or another. We’ve had quite a few shows over the years with their oh-so-appealing PC game mediums that, on the outside, looked just as promising as their key visuals, and then their anime adaptations came and went, just to be shells of their former selves. Think of shows like studio Feel’s adaptations of Summer2018’s Island to the grandfather of all VNs: Spring and Summer 2019’s Kono Yo no Hate de Koi o Utau Shoujo YU-NO a.k.a YU-NO: A Girl Who Chants Love at the Bound of this World, but those adaptations were just bad, and as much as I would recommend Island over YU-NO if you need to gander at anime’s past records of VNs (which both shows I would not recommend to watch more when you reach a certain point of the anime counterparts), there’s actually, finally, a somewhat faithful adaptation of the medium itself. And that, my friends, is Atri: My Dear Moments, courtesy of the same developer as Island alongside Makura (creator of one of the best VNs of all time: The Fruit of Grisaia), written by Asuka Konno of 2012’s VN If My Heart Had Wings, and published by Aniplex under their Aniplex.exe brand.

The visual novel that was released in PC back in June 2020, I’m not going to dive any deep into the plot, because either the anime’s synopsis or its own Wikipedia entry (which is actually quite extensive) tells you enough of what to expect out of the anime as it follows its plot very closely, and to the T. The TL;DR of the anime, with the closest comparison being that of Spring 2015’s Plastic Memories, is that it tells its story of the cognitive memories that once lay dormant, which slowly gives way to a richer plot of what it means to be human through love and affection. That is the relationship of its central duo: the one-legged MC of Natsuki Ikaruga, who, after losing his loved ones and even losing a part of a body in an accident, relies on a prosthetic to get by in his small house of a submarine, as well as the android that he found, sunken in what used to be a part of the world that’s now threatened by a rise in sea levels that could cause the end of humanity, of a regular young girl named Atri. The girl who was once touted as a way to settle off a debt, soon becomes part of the rag-tag group of Natsuki and his friends of caretaker Catherine and childhood friends of Minamo Kamishiro and Ryuji Nojima, and the revelations soon follow as the humans try to ascertain what this “high performance” of a toaster robot has in store for them, despite having amnesia and developing her own sense of self-consciousness in the process that leads to the romance between the human and the half-human, half-robot Humanoid.

I’d already mentioned that Atri is similar to Plastic Memories, and for those who’ve seen said series in the past, you’ll find a lot of similarities between the Sai Corporation’s Giftia Isla and the android herself. Both girls are “reasonably” aged like teenager/middle-school selves as much as possible to get us, the audience, to slowly warm up to them and see what they’re capable of, having been risen to the surface and/or awakened to a hidden ticking time-bomb on their lives: being only able to function on a certain set period of time. And Atri is no different in that regard, as we see her being the bubbly and lively girl who doesn’t seem to present any concrete evidence about her true functionality from the beginning, right as the series progresses to find that Atri is no mere android that left a wave of catastrophe behind the back of her creation, and of how the nonsense robot that’s the ire of Natsuki’s numerous infamies, had quite the impact on him and his family tree. But most certainly, being around a group of middle-school kids to the college dropout that is Natsuki, Atri’s maturity feels a bit wishy-washy, almost as if the producers want her to age fast within the span of the anime, which almost pushes her to the brink of being forced melodrama (which the VN has the same plot, but thankfully hours of gameplay to go through every minute detail of). For sure, you can say that even the romance between Natsuki and Atri just feels pedestrian as compared to the likes of Tsukasa Mizugaki and Isla, but as much as both series serve their own purposes, it’s nothing to be scoffed at since the revelations of Atri only sully Natsuki’s heart all the more, giving him a reason to re-evaluate his heart of what does it mean to love and to be loved, aside from his rather serious and grumpy no-nonsense personality. To be fair, as much as I like the kinship of the friends around them, it’s still Natsuki and Atri’s story of humanity through grief, loss, friendship, and ultimately the romance between the two, which feels earned, despite the negative connotations of the relationship between human and humanoid.

Being an Aniplex-backed project, it’s no surprise given the great amount of detail and lustre that the anime had, it’s just great to see such stunning animation that perfectly captures the vibes from the VN in all its glory, thanks to veteran scriptwriter Jukki Hanada. But then again, apart from the show neither being its subsidiary studios helming the anime, this is a standard that studio TROYCA and one of its best in-house directors of Makoto Kato have been working since his days as an episode director for the Aldnoah.Zero series, to becoming the full-blown director that he is today with nothing but consistency of his class for at least a long decade now (if you forget the poorly written anime of Spring 2022’s Gunjou no Fanfare a.k.a Fanfare of Adolescence, yet another Aniplex show). TROYCA’s chief director Ei Aoki’s influence is undisputed in the studio’s philosophy since its creation more than a decade ago back in May 2013, and Makoto Kato is certainly one of its successors who kept the vision alive with the anime, and Atri’s production values are certainly on par of what we’ve come to expect from the studio.

The music is rather apt for the anime, though I’d be kidding if it serves as one of the highlights of the show overall. The OST’s certainly there that’s definitely ripped from the VN itself, but I felt as if the anime didn’t really bring or add anything new to an already emotionally gripping series such as Atri, though I’d argue that it’s playing too much on the safe side. And of course, despite having Aniplex’s own Sony Music idol groups of the renowned Nogizaka46, as well as one of its newest groups of 22/7 (which had its own anime back in Winter 2020), these are songs that play the very part of gripping the audience with its thematics, but even not as a fan of both groups, I can still tell that they’re quality songs that speak the anime’s story of a thousand pictures. Alas (and this is just IMO) both the former’s OP and the latter’s ED are just decent songs at best, but quite forgettable at the same time as well.

If you need an adaptation that knows what the anime medium is set out to do and replicates its source material as close as possible, you can’t really go wrong with Atri: My Dear Moments. It is to date, the most respected source material adaptation that the VN medium has so far seen, even though you can’t quite takeaway the feeling of the few-hours-long gameplay that Makoto Kato, Jukki Hanada and the staff team had to cut down just to make-do for the anime itself, that in the end, replication in a summary form is always better as promotional material for the game itself, just like with all AniManga. It’s just that the balance of tension for a series like this that just sets it off-kilter for me, and while weighing a moderate duration game (like within less than 8 hours) against the span of 13 episodes is no easy feat, I kinda felt that Atri was intentionally written to be a linear series rather than one with its multiple, complex branches that gives more content and flavour (or maybe I’m just too fixated with better anime adaptations of VNs in the past decade or so) that other mediums can adapt easily, and this is most likely the case with the anime.

Atri: My Dear Moments is a solid show that goes back to the heart of humanity, be it with comedy or romance in general, but while I’ve definitely seen better VN anime adaptations in the past, it's still a show to pick up and watch if you've haven't already done so."

However, this show is about a loli robot and her romantic relationship with our adult main character. Before anyone starts going at me for complaining about something that has been a common discussion for years in the anime community, let's get one thing straight: Atri looks like a child, dresses like a child,acts like a child, thinks like a child and learns like a child, so she IS A CHILD! And her relationship with Natsuki is CREEPY! i don't care how many times this show tries to tell me that ""she's actually 33 years old"" or ""she's a robot so it's different"", it's creepy either way!

53128,539766.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Man, it seems like visual novel adaptations are starting to come back. Not a whole lot compared to the previous decades, but the fact that some are still being made is nice to hear. I previously played and reviewed the original game for Atri: My Dear Moments, a little after an anime adaptation was announced (You can find my review of the game here: https://joyousmenma93 .livejournal. com/710659. html). Short version: While I did enjoy parts of the game, I did feel other parts could have been improved upon, but it was a valiant first game for Aniplex.exe to start with. With the knowledge I gleanedfrom the game, I was curious as to how the anime would adapt it, especially since the game itself is a fairly short 10-13 hours. It's inevitable that long visual novels would need to leave things out in the transition from a game to the TV format, especially a 12-13 episode series. On the whole, I do think the anime adaptation for Atri succeeded in its goal of adapting the game to a TV format, but it did make quite a few changes from the game. Some I liked, some...not so much, and the ones that didn't work are the anime's biggest problems.

In the near future, a sudden rise in sea levels floods the majority of the world and ends human civilization as we know it, forcing humanity to eke a living on what little dry land remains. Natsuki Ikaruga, a boy who lost his mother and his leg in an accident some years earlier, returns disillusioned from a harsh life in the big city to find his old countryside home half-swallowed by the sea. Left without a family, all he has to his name is the ship and submarine left to him by his oceanologist grandmother, and her debts. His only hope to restore the dreams for the future that he lost is to take up an opportunity presented to him by the suspicious debt collector Catherine. They set sail to search the sunken ruins of his grandmother's laboratory in order to find a treasure rumor says she left there. What they find is not riches or jewels; but a strange girl lying asleep in a coffin at the bottom of the sea. The girl, Atri, is a robot, but is so expressive and human-like that she could easily pass for a real human being. As thanks for salvaging her, Atri declares that she'll serve as Natsuki's leg until the end of the summer. The time they spend together over that summer changes the both of them.

I won't go into every single change the anime made from the game, as that'd make this review way longer than it needs to be, and I won't belabor a lot of what I said in my review of the game. I'll stick to my usual format before going into the nitty-gritty, starting with the animation. TROYCA, famous for Idolish7, was picked to do the animation, and while they couldn't quite replicate the finer details of Yusano and Moto4's character designs, they make up for that with kinetic character motion and fidelity to said character designs. They did, however, succeed in bringing the game's backgrounds and setting to life without compromising on the details. I also appreciate that the animators gave characters who didn't have sprites in the game actual designs, so it definitely has that going for it. On the sound front, I definitely appreciate that the anime decided to make its own original soundtrack as opposed to just reusing background tracks from the game, with the exception of a few, with one of them being important to the plot. I wasn't a fan of the overly chirpy ending theme, but as someone who usually doesn't like idol songs, I really liked the opening theme, Nogizaka46's ""Ano Hikari."" I never skipped it every time I watched an episode, it's that good. Hikaru Akao is still annoying when she sings in her squeaky voice, though.

A lot of the changes the anime makes is rearranging some events to make them happen either earlier or later than in the game, which does make some sense considering this is a 13-episode anime as opposed to a 13 hour game. The characters and their respective development remain the same from the game, even if a lot of aspects that put them on the path to getting it are either changed, downplayed, or cut out. Unfortunately, a few changes I didn't like were removing huge chunks of several characters' backstories, with Natsuki being the biggest victim of this. While his personality and development are the same as in the game, some really important parts of his backstory are cut out completely, such as leaving the Academy due to a combination of his own arrogance and a teacher being ableist towards him, both of which form the backbone of his development. By cutting those parts out, Natsuki comes across as much more needlessly angsty and mopey potato-kun. On the opposite side, Catherine and another character are made to be much nicer, with their more questionable actions watered down compared to the game. The anime seems to speed-run through the slice-of-life parts just to get to the plot faster, and while I can understand why they did this, as many who played the game complained that the plot should have happened a lot earlier, they kind of diluted the parts of the game that were genuinely good, such as the whole arc about the kids building a generator for the school.

There is one change that I definitely liked. In the last third of a game, there's a new character who gets introduced named Yasuda, who hates Atri and wants to kill her. He's universally despised by fans of the game due to a combination of his appearance completely lacking any established build-up or foreshadowing so it feels like he comes out of nowhere, and for being a generic villain whose motivations are really weak and tenuous at best. The anime doesn't change his characterization nor give him more depth and nuance, but it does go out of its way to address the first issue with him in that they add in whole new scenes where he's not only going after Atri multiple times, he even goes after other characters directly and using different methods, whether it be appealing to their guilty conscious or straight up trying to kill them, ranging from shooting them or unhooking Natsuki's submarine to wash him out to sea. While I do wish Yasuda's backstory had been fleshed out more, or given a stronger motivation for hating Atri than what he has, I definitely appreciate the anime's attempts to make him a more constant presence and a genuine threat, and it seems like the manga is doing the same.

But there is one addition the anime made that I really, REALLY wish they hadn't. Remember how in my review of the game, I mentioned that I absolutely hated the scene where Natsuki slips and falls into Minamo's boobs because it felt like unnecessary fanservice? The anime removes that, thank God (As does the manga)...but it also adds in new scenes involving Atri being sexualized or offering herself up to Natsuki in what's clearly meant to be a sexual manner, when she clearly looks and acts like an elementary schooler! Like, TROYCA, did we REALLY need a scene where Atri flashes her nude body to Natsuki several times when she's wearing nothing but a bath towel? I mean, it's at an angle where we can't see her nude, but come on! The game at least kept it limited to Atri jokingly calling Natsuki naughty and jumping to conclusions before she gets conked on the head! It's like the show is worried that we won’t care about Atri (and her death flags) unless we’ve been assured she’s a potential sex object, and it does a disservice to the story’s stronger emotional beats. Who thought deciding to openly sexualize Atri MORE was a good idea?! Because it isn't! Basically, Atri the anime traded one form of unnecessary fanservice for another, and it just makes me cringe into a singularity.

It's honestly a shame the anime decided to implement a lot of those more questionable changes, because I did enjoy the rest of my time with this show, and I want to recommend it to people who don't want to play the game or are unable to for whatever reason. I like the animation, the music, the opening song, most of the characters, and some of the better changes Atri: My Dear Moments made. But the not-so-good changes leave a pretty big black stain on what on paper is still a fairly decent adaptation of Aniplex.exe's first visual novel. Personally, if you want the better experience, I recommend just playing the game, if you're able. The anime is fine if you're into it or can't play the game for whatever reason, but I really wish I could recommend it more enthusiastically."

Its story had a lot of ups and downs, but as this one wrapped up I couldn’t deny this one had a lot more good than bad. I liked the central romance and the debate of humanoids and their emotional capacity for a variety of different things. While it isn’t a new idea by any means, it still works extremely well and opens the story up to a lot more interpretation for the viewer and allows them to feel their own way about the events. The animation quality itselfwas really strong, and the character designs worked really well. My only issue would be that I felt like the ending rushed things just a bit too much. While I loved the ending and sometimes things are better left unsaid, I can’t help but feel like taking a bit more time at the very ending scene would have helped wrap up some plot threads that I don’t feel were closed off particularly well."

The anime may seem OK for an anime-only, but I highly suggest you to read the VN before watching the anime for the following reasons: * the anime can be 1/4 considered as original, because it killed the two most important plots of the story, and tried to cook something to make it still consistent on its own. * it also killed a lot of charadev, by making secondarytwo tertiary characters (before skipping one of the two lol) and by orienting the anime further as a comedy than a dramatic story, to the point I didn't even cried once during my watching session (while I did it several times during the VN, and I cry easily). Ah and it even killed a lot of what makes the character Atri so endearing...

It's just something light-hearted that you can enjoy after having an exhausting day. I sincerely hope that there will be a second season, because I did enjoyed it. The main character doesn't want to be the strongest or have revenge on a villain. He just want to raise the confused andinnocent kids that he found in a dangerous forest. He isn't even man that he got accidentally killed by a god and was resurrected in another world.

The music is up-beat and pleasant, the voice acting was solid enough, and the animation style fit the project.

I'm using it as a cleanser between some much darker and heavier stories and it's PERFECT for that. (Along similar lines as another where an abused salaryman died from falling out of bed and was reincarnated as a kid who did great things with slimes. I forget the name but it serves a similar purpose for me as that one did.)

As an ""anime in total"" I'd give this a 6.5, I'm rounding it up to 7 because for the TYPE/style of anime it is and what it's trying to be it does that particular thing quite well.

57380,538071.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"**Cuteness Overload** It may turn off some people for being plotless, but this isekai is a guilty pleasure of mine. Basically, a god accidentally killed a man Kayano Takumo, so he had no choice but to live in another world. There he meets two children and he is acting as their guardian. It goes without saying that they are overpowered. And the rest is their story. It has no plot but it has events where Takumi and his kids Allen and Elena gain experience through various adventures such as conquering dungeons or gathering certain herbs. They also gain animal friends. There's nothing remarkable about the art andanimation, and they don't need to. Basically, they're just there to explore the world and the point is that these kids are just there for the guilty pleasure of seeing cute kids doing cute things. It's so much wholesome that it's safe to watch it with your kids.

Each episode is one complete whole. They may change scenery but it follows from the scene earlier, unlike many episodes of Giji Harem where it was several skits thrown together into one torturous episode. This is how you do a plotless episode that's actually enjoyable.

Missed opportunities: The god here, Silphyleel, is a very funny character. At one point, I felt that this show was funnier than Deer Friend. He was prominent in Episode 1 but rarely do we see him. As enjoyable as this anime was, it would have been even better if he had been around.

I won't mind a season 2, but just like the similar isekai Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear, I don't see it having a serious plot down the road."

For better or worse even though they are two characters they basically act as one for almost the entirety of the anime. So essentially it reduces the interaction 2: Everything else in the anime is, kinda mediocre. The pets dont even show up for multiple episodes at a time. The other characters are average at best, and thats if they even show up. The anime is not outright terrible, the main thing is it kinda fumbles the main gimmick of the twins and there really isnt anythingelse special about it.

I dont ""dislike"" the anime, its very difficult to recommend though unless the viewer is specifically, wanting a low key low stakes filler anime. ""Switch off brain"" anime, so to speak.

I was expecting a slow paced iyashikei with lots of cute kid activities, but these kids do not do kid activities, trust me. This anime has no meat - there's a weak story thrown in there, but it doesn't really do much for it, it feels like it was put there just because it's supposed to have one. That said, the show is still funto watch, just don't expect any engaging plots, it's basically a man and two kids adventuring and having fun doing it.

The show doesn’t really have much of a plot, there’s no grand storyline or dramatic conflicts. It’s more of a slice-of-life series with light-hearted adventures and wholesome moments.

There is no overaching story, with the main focus being the daily interactions of the MC and his adopted children. This anime could just as easily have been set in the modern world, and still, 99% of the plot could remain unaltered. Basically, just turn your brain off and relax looking at cute characters doing cute things. If there is one thing to complain about, it would be regarding how overly kind the MC is. He refuses payment even when he is properly deserving of being compensated, and there's a whole mini scene that basically repeatsitself every time the MC acts stupid like this.

Generally I only watch it if it promises something not bog-standard, or if it interests me, or if it promises its heart to me, or if it's really cute... This isekai was more to my liking then most, which is to say, not very, but still. I watched it through. The ""hook"" to this isekai is that the MC finds a couple of children, and takes them in as his own, and makes his way through the isekai world as a father or older brother or something. It was mostly a useless hook, except they did one thing really well, andit was enough to impress me.  They made the children actual children.

I remember another anime, and I've watched so many I've forgotten which one, where there's a little girl about six years old found under similar circumstances, and she's, well, a little adult.  She's bussing tables at the bar, being all cute, and everyone falls in love with her.  These children aren't like that.  They're children.  They're not quite as mercurial, noisy, and messy as real children are, but they process things much like real children would.  They ape what they adults do without really understanding why they do it, they pounce on things with little thought and single-mindedly, they hide behind the MCs legs when they're scared...  they're five year old children.

That's really refreshing.

It's not done perfectly.  As I said, they're not as fussy, irritable, and mercurial as children can be, but they got it half right, and considering how most isekais treat children, well, I'll take it.

Other than that, it's a bog standard isekai with an OP MC, and, well... that did get kinda boring.

Guess it's okay.  You might like it if you like isekais.  At least they tried to be unique."

Side note unlike Solo leveling it seem magic items and skills only work within a limited range of the dungeon entrance and the worldbuilding is a little lacking 

the voice acting is ok No dubs have been made at time of review the art style not too bad similar to a lot of silver link or j.c staff series although this anime was produced by Gekkou the animation is also not bad

57646,537064.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"A Nobody's Way Up to an Exploration Hero - Does the inspiration to go dungeon exploring make for a ""zero to hero"" experience? Many a times, yes...but in this show, sadly not. Life's daily heroes and their antics giveth and maketh the dreamers of the young to have aspirations doing huge, notable things for themselves, being the aft influencers to be given inspiration and to do things for the better. That is a good thing, and for the eponymous novelist Kaitou, that's exactly his plan with penning such a story with Mob kara Hajimaru Tansaku Eiyūtan a.k.a A Nobody's Way Up to an Exploration Hero, toshowcase a decent fantasy merging both the literal human world with fantasy elements, where humans can access dungeons through a portal designated by its own building to give the fantasy experience right from the comfort outside of their own home.

However (and this is a BIG however), through the grapevine of the anime adapting the LN (and its WN counterpart), the constant argument of its manga adaptation being so different from the original source material is a valid argument in and of itself. I'd argue, rather, that the manga adaptation is basically superior when compared to the anime that considers heavy consequences as well as more nuance with the plot, which takes a lot of liberties since Kaitou is rather finicky with what he wants the different mediums to be, if it was never to be a close 1-to-1 adaptation. That's just my 2 cents on the matter.

But back to the anime itself. Being inspired by an adult who traverses the dungeon with enthusiasm, only to then go missing one day, this is the plot of MC Kaito Takagi to go to the dungeon to help find said missing adult, which is someone whom he actually holds close to his heart because he is just simply known as Captain Katsuragi, the father of his childhood friend Haruka Katsuragi, whom was dealt a blow when the news came out during her growing-up years. Since then, Kaito has made it his calling to make a name for himself, but alas, being a low-level adventurer meant that low-level slimes were the only way that he would grind to even level up as a decent adventurer. That is until after the killings of 1,000 slimes, that he obtains a rare Summoning card containing a valiant warrior that he could choose to sell to obtain loads of cash or use it to help him conquer the deeper troughes of the dungeon. Being the money-conscious guy that he is, Kaito contemplates selling the rare card, but ultimately summons the warrior to aid his low-level weakling, revealing a capable Valkyrie.

Let's get the TL;DR for the show out of the way: having valiant warriors ranging from Valkyries to actual Demons being loli girls, one would think that Kaito is growing a loli harem just for the sake of his adventuring, even though both Sylphy and Luceria possess poignant powers enough to kill off deep-level monsters to cultivate experience. It's just fantasy wish-fulfillment for the sake of not having a story plot, or rather, a free-spirited one to chock, which matters take the most priority as Kaito and the other adventurers whom he would meet on the way, see fit. And despite having close guy friends around him who are just as concerned as his childhood friend, whom Haruka has developed an immunity to traverse the dungeon and also wanting to win Kaito's heart being the childhood friend trope, the latter is just that: a free-spirited person who does things on impulse and never second guesses his assumptions. Even with the forthcoming group of Airi Jinguji and her two friends Miku Moriyama and Hikari Tanabe, all 3 girls being in a party that Kaito joins in the gang to meet new friends and adventure together, love and romance are not things that is in the mind of Kaito, even as Haruka persists on interrogating him if he ever goes to the dungeons, only to have said boy try to deflect his answers as much as possible without hurting her in the process. I admire that intention, but also, this boy's brain is literally dense, as much as he is a Samaritan to the people around him. Boy's got his priorities right or wrong, it's up to the viewer to decide in many a context of the scenarios in this show.

Despite getting into anime production for just over a year now, studio Gekkou's production values have been mediocre at best, and this show continues the (un)fortunate streak of the studio just cutting corners at its animation. For reference, most of which are reused scenes (especially dungeon walls) since the work itself doesn't offer many varieties, and instead, relies on standard tropes and such to tell its rather garbage story. It is what it is, and you just can't unlook at it the first time you see it.

Not even Amatsuki's OP, May'n ED, nor the OST stacks up, which is NOT a shame, because frankly, they're quite terrible too, despite trying to be a whimsical kids' adventure theme, but grown-up.

If you're keen to try this show, be my guest, because at least for the 3-episode rule, this show is not remarkable, but not bad either. It's a cutesy anime for those who like it that way, but you can't hide the truth that it just frankly, sucks in all fronts.

57646,539215.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"From an adult point of view this was a very average anime. It feels like it was made for children rather than a more mature audience (no gore, low stakes, no strong language). For older viewers this is a very mediocore experience. There was nothing particularly unique or interesting about the permise and the characters felt pretty generic. Even a ""bad"" anime usually has that one memorable character, because they were funny, weird or unique. This anime dosent even have one memorable character, they are all extremely generic. There was also no deep plot beyond, a mysterious dungeon appears and the main character wants toexplore it."

Rimuru is still having meetings about meetings and when to have more meetings, so I need something with a little action. I almost wish Rimuru would show up here and do some demon lord damage.

55749,537630.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"The Café Terrace and Its Goddesses Season 2 - It's the return of the Quintessential Quintuplets rip-off that imitated the way after its rival did so, with quintuply double the trouble...to find a marriage partner? Getting introduced to the Gotoubun no Hanayome rip-off that was the rom-com master Seo Kouji's Megami no Café Terrace a.k.a The Café Terrace and Its Goddesses, or you've read the manga in its full expose, you've already known about what's to come of the garbage stank that would be his latest series if you watched Season 1 back last Spring (of 2023). I'm not going to rehash what I've said inmy already substantial review done for that, basically all that needs to be noted about the series is just the rom-com formula done to ""perfection"" as Seo Kouji likes his works to be: overly extensive (like a certain Kanojo, Okarishimasu a.k.a Rent-a-Girlfriend's author Reiji Miyajima) with no clear winner, dragging out for as long as he possibly could do for the audience to speculate on who could be the winning girl for MC Hayato Kasukabe (unlike a certain Negi Haruba, which I'm kinda thankful for that Gotoubun no Hanayome is not overstretched, but is STILL being milked as a series for all its worth today).

Still, I did promise to take a look at the anime series in its later adaptations of the manga, and how does Season 2's content actually hold up against its premiere season? Surprisingly good I'd say. It's not great, but there's some originality done here that warrants a second look into either medium of the books or the small screen.

With Season 2 adapting Volumes 6 to the early chapters of Volume 10, Hayato and his harem of the new generation Familia maids must now contend with competition from an old rival that seemingly still feuds against the aforementioned cafe's new owner to create a look-for-look similarly exact replica of a copycat cafe, both maid servants and food combined that's enough to put the still fledgling generations of a cafe out of business. The 5 new girls that would make up the imitation Family Cafe: aspiring author Hekiru Yoshino, chef descendant Moemi Soya, ldol-likeful Ririka Chiyoda, travelling foreigner Valentina Azuma and amateur model Mao Takasaki, each and every one of the girls are handpicked solely for their similarity when compared against the Familia girls, and the heated battle to win customers ensues, which has been a problem for the new Familia trying to pick up on their own two feet after the passing of Hayato's beloved grandmother Sachiko.

For one thing, Season 2 definitely gave its premiere season a run for its money by introducing even more characters into the mix, but not slightly too different as each main girl gets their reasonably-sized opponent from the talent that they offer, such as between Riho and Ririka being popularity figures themselves, and the more obvious Shiragiku and Moemi being competitive chefs with foodie talent to bring to the kitchen table. And for one, I thought that this was a welcome change to stand out from an already crowded rom-com market of authors trying to do similar themes whilst making it their wholly own, and Seo Kouji definitely pulled a Fuuka here to bring the series back to relevance (well, at least the anime anyways) in a way to get us the audience to once again be like fans watching the Gotoubun no Hanayome rip-off to see which girl would win Hayato's heart. It's awfully and predictably self-explantory, but you get the point of where I'm driving if the anime is to follow the manga's paces in the future.

Otherwise, it's pretty much the same story with Tezuka Productions and returning series director Satoshi Kuwabara still adapting the series justice with an even greater production. The year-long wait for Season 2 is definitely worth the wait for Cafe Terrace fans to see where the schlong will not just grow the yonder of the heart, but also to carry on the legacy of the Familia Café for time to come.

If there's one negativity however, despite the OST while being the same, both of Hikari Kodama's OP and VTuber Aglio, Olio e Peperoncino a.k.a Pepechi's ED are kinda underwhelming songs, though they abstractly fit the series to a T. It's not bad, but I'd think that Season 1 has the better pair of theme songs with NeRiAme's catchy OP (which I still remember to this day) and Miki Sato's great ED.

There's never been a good time to be a Megami no Café Terrace a.k.a The Café Terrace and Its Goddesses fan like now, because while Seo Kouji has a working formula of the series to come for the anime side of the source material adaptation, you can still choose to spoil yourself by reading ahead with the manga. But I digress as doing it this way will make or break expectations (just as how Negi Haruba got so much controversy with Gotoubun no Hanayome's out-of-whack ending), and if you're already feeling burnt on how the actual quintuple harem turned out, I suggest you stick to the anime adaptation and its future developments for a better overall experience.

If anything, Seo Kouji, please don't turn Cafe Terrace into another Quintessential Quintuplets. You still have a chance to turn things around"
55749,537914.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"After watching the first season of Seo Kouji's Megami no Café Terrace and enjoying it (mostly), there were a few things that I wanted to see improved in the second season. For the most part, the second season was indeed a progression on the first season, and the anime remains a solidly upper-tier harem show featuring a likable MC and a good mix of women seeking his affection. However, some areas were improved more notably than others. 1. Humor -> The first season often felt quite stiff and a bit cliché when it came to the comedic aspects. On the contrast, the second season improves considerablyin this department. Many of Ami's (the main source of comic relief) slapstick gags are actually funny and the addition of the second set of girls in Valentina, Ririka, Moemi, Hekiru, and Mao adds a further element of chaos and motivation for the main cast. There does tend to be a bit too much focus on Hayato's, ahem, nether regions at times, albeit it's not like this is much different from real life regardless of sexuality. 

2. Romance -&gt; This is the main area where there was a bit of disappointment in S2 after some promising developments in S1, particularly with Akane and Riho. While there were no doubt some special moments between Hayato and the girls, it did seem like a sizable chunk of it was forced to a degree. Akane remains the most upfront and forward with her affections, but it also doesn't seem to resonate with Hayato as much since it's clear he doesn't want to be pressured into relationships with anyone. Ami and Shiragiku get some additional development this season, although not to the degree that'd I'd say either of them are the favorites. The same can be said of tsundere Ouka, whose bombshell at the end of the season was really her only standout moment in S2. Riho is probably the strongest candidate following this season, as we learn more of her backstory and there seems to be some genuine moments of monogamy between her and Hayato. With that said, Shiragiku, Akane, and Riho getting locked into a three-headed fight for Hayato's affections puts a bit of a damper on his individual romances with the three of them. Overall, I'd like to see more one-on-one time between Hayato and each girl that feels natural should a S3 be released and the story receives its conclusion. These are adult characters, after all.

3. Fanservice -&gt; While S2 certainly does not shy away from the more risqué bits much like S1, the censorship was to the point that it became distracting at times in its bluntness, which is not a great thing for a show that uses ecchi as one of its selling points. There did seem to be a bit of decline in the quality of the artwork and animation as a whole, although not necessarily enough to detract significantly from the overall product.

4. Backstories -&gt; Another aspect that was improved/maintained from S1, as we get more complete background information on Riho, Akane, and Ami in particular. Akane's band could use some more presence in the show as it gets relegated to offscreen in S2, and perhaps some of the other background characters like Ouka's sister and (unapologetically) the confectionary seller ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). Also we still don't really know much about Shiragiku other than that she was a friend of Hayato's in childhood and was close to his grandmother.

As a whole, Megami no Café Terrace S2 delivered on most of its promises and remains a recommended watch for those looking for an enjoyable, non-high school harem romp. This is a story that needs an end, so I do hope it will get additional adaptation to find out just who is the mother of Hayato's daughter and the progression of romance leading up to that..."
55749,537656.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"The fight for Hayato’s love is heating up, and the girls are increasing their efforts, while Hayato is stuck in the middle. In this season of the show, do we continue to follow the life of the small cafe Familia. Where both love struggles continue and the business aspect also keeps evolving. There is shown how the harem situation is heating up with Hayato being pressed by the girls, and still trying to keep his grandma's cafe going. For the plot of the season, is it very much focused on building up the characters and their surroundings. This is shown through introducing new characters and digging intothe characters background, which is connected to either the girls' love for Hayato or cafe’s success. But it does follow much of the same style of the previous season, with the extra twist of the timeline Hayato has is closing in, since he had one year to make the cafe successful.

The characters are more detailed this season, where we get to dig further into the background of each of the girls, and with it Hayato too. This progression is often supported by the characters that are introduced, which gives it a breath of fresh air and also gives some support to the characters. But overall the characters are very much the same as in the previous season.

When it comes to the genre of the show, is it very much living up to all of its aspects. It's a clear romcom, with focus on both romance and comedy, the jokes through the ecchi part and other scenes, and the romantic life actually progressing. All of the girls also get a fair amount of attention throughout, which makes it feel like everyone could be a contender, which feels good as harem.

The animation is just like the previous season, with lots of beautiful girls and some both funny and beautiful scenes.

55749,540102.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I wasn't expecting much from this anime, but it did surprise me. It's a lot better than the first season. § Overview It continues with the degenerate moments and fanservice of the first season. A competitor moves in and tries to copy Familia and name their cafe Family including having 5 gorgeous girls as their waitresses. Good thing Shiragiku found a way to make better meals that made them win over them. Eventually, these other waitresses became friends with our Familia girls. So there are now more girls pining for Hayato. Of course, Hayato meets some of these girls' grandmothers, and there's a shocking move atthe end of the season.


§ Notes

In the first season, you can't help but feel that this is a rip-off of the Quintessential Quintuplets. You were looking for fun, but it doesn't give you that. The episodes don't exactly flow so well.

But in the second season, we get to know them better. From absolute strangers, as if by fate, they were actually related to Hayato's grandmother. 

Thus, they have better character development here. 

With the addition of 5 more girls in the harem, the fanservice got even more ridiculous. This part is a mixed one. If you're a gooner, this is a great anime. But if not, it will leave you cold. YMMV. 

I like that for a change, they were able to move to different places because season 1 makes it feel that the people involved are confined in the cafe. 


§ Conclusion

I enjoyed this better than season 1. It had more substance than the Quintessential Quintuplets, but it was not as enjoyable."
55749,538339.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"So, I walked into Season 2 of ""Cafe Terrace and Its Goddesses"" with high hopes, fully expecting the same blend of romantic hijinks and slice-of-life charm that caught my attention in the first season. I mean, who doesn’t enjoy a decent dose of harem drama sprinkled with cutesy moments? The first season was a fun ride, albeit one that felt a tad like a ripoff of ""The Quintessential Quintuplets."" But hey, who am I to judge? I happily devoured that idea until I noticed something awful creeping in like a soggy bun in an otherwise tasty sandwich. This season was about as enjoyable as a roomfull of unfinished homework. The story stumbled around like a panda on roller skates, and the character writing? Let's just say it had all the depth of a kiddie pool. What happened to the hooks and genuine heart? It felt like many of the dialogues were slapped together for convenience—evidence of this was glaring in that cringe-worthy scene with Ami's grandma. Seriously, was that heartfelt, or did someone accidentally edit in a random soap opera script? I half-expected a dramatic soundtrack to start playing. (I think it actually got played too lmao)

Now, let’s talk about the harem aspect. Initially, it was engaging enough and seemed to suggest a lighthearted competition. But then the plot decided to binge-watch itself and dished us ‘glimpses of the future,’ effectively giving us a hint that there is indeed a winner. Just when I thought it couldn’t get any wilder, the author chucked in another five ladies into the mix—like adding extra toppings to an already overloaded pizza. I can only describe it as plain absurdity; I’m still questioning how that was a necessary plot to be added. I mean, keeping track of names was hard enough!

And while I know how wild harem shows can get, from the looks of the first season, I never expected it to get as wild as ""High School DxD."" Although that might be an overstatement but you do get my point. If the first season was trying to pay homage to ""The Quintessential Quintuplets,"" this season felt more like a parody, complete with clumsy attempts at humor that seemed to miss the mark more often than not. 

Picture this: you stroll into the café like it’s a battle royale, but suddenly the main character turns into superman without his invulnerability, getting kissed and ""abused"" relentlessly by all these so-called goddesses. Honestly, it felt less like playful flirting and more like a one-man comedy skit of 'What Can Go Wrong?' Gotta love the abundance of boundaries shattered, right?

What was supposed to be lighthearted escapades turned into a what-is-happening-to-my-eyes spectacle that left me more uncomfortable than amused. It's like watching someone put way too much hot sauce on their taco—at first, you're intrigued, but then you're just hoping they don't spontaneously combust.

In the end, the second season of ""Cafe Terrace and Its Goddesses"" was a major downer. All the magic and charisma evaporated faster than my will to review it! Instead of the delightful narrative I expected, what I got was more chaos than character engagement, leaving me scrabbling for something amusing—anything—to salvage my faith in the show. So, unless you have a penchant for hot sauce dancing and cozy kitchen shenanigans gone rogue, I’d suggest giving this season a raincheck."
56449,537931.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Just finished the final episode, and I was unfortunately very disappointed. The premise of the show was interesting, the slowly budding romance was natural and sweet, and the drama and business ventures were engaging. But as the episodes continued, the animation quality declined drastically and the plot slammed on the brakes. Firstly, the animation was never incredible, but it started out decent. However, with each episode, characters looked more off-model than not, and still-shots slowly increased. The last episode was the worst, with more than half of the episode being still-shots of some sort. Absolutely unacceptable quality. The next drawback was the plot's pacing. Thefirst three episodes had good drama (though it was a bit quick in my opinion) but it helped get me hooked. However, once Dahlia's first large hurdle was cleared, there were no other hurdles in the race. I would've preferred if Dahlia built up her business without her father's favors. As of now, it feels like everyone is just helping her because she's so-and-so's daughter and they like her. Watching that isn't very interesting plot-wise. The season had 12 episodes to build to something up, either artifacts-related, business-related, or romance, but it really didn't. I'm sure with another season, this would be solved easily, but with such poor animation, I don't think anyone would want to. 
Overall, I really wanted to be immersed in Dahlia's journey, but I'm so distracted by the poor animation quality that I couldn't. If this somehow gets another season, I'll watch it since the show was decent, but let us all pray for a higher animation budget."
56449,538468.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Cheap, uninspired and excruciatingly boring. It's just poorly animated off-model people sitting and having baby's first attempt at dialogue over and over and over again. I did exhale through my nose one or two times in the first few episodes while heroine was dealing with the divorce proceedings, but it all just kept going downhill from there. Moving forward from the divorce it's more or less the same scenario repeating every few episodes. Someone says ""I've got a problem"", Dahliya replies ""I've got the solution for it right here, give me a minute to craft it"". She slaps together a prototype thing, it becomes immediatelysuccessful, everybody claps and takes the rest of the work off her hands to do it behind the scenes while she indulges her drinking problem with her not-yet-boyfriend. 

It isn't (at least not in any meaningful sense) an anime about her career path as an artificer. The creative process behind the profession is basically ""make an outline of a thing from our world and slap a matchy elemental stone/colored slime paste onto it"". It also isn't about her business career — each time she needs to handle a business related issue, one of the supporting characters appears, gazes longingly into a window, says ""you know, I owe a lot to your father, so I'm gonna deal with this for you, also here's a cookie, share it with your boyfriend"", aaaand that's it, she's free to go develop an alcohol addiction. 

Oh, so it's mainly a love story? A business lady meets an aristocrat guy, they eat local food, drink local alcohol, chat and learn more about the world? Go on dates to see local attractions? Well... Kind of. Like if you fed thirty bargain bin romance story books to ChatGPT and asked it to make you one of those set in an isekai. 
It will spew out something moderately coherent, but since it can't actually understand what it writes, it will forget the prior episode's introduction of ice stones as an existing method of refrigeration and will have characters lose their minds about heroine's next unbelievable magical tool — ""the fridge"".

Everything about this anime is just a thoughtless amalgamation of fantasy-ish buzzwords slapped together to serve as a backdrop for 12 episodes of compliments heroine will receive from everyone around her about what a genius she is. If the genders were reversed I'd think this is just Elon Mask's isekai self-insert fanfiction."
56449,537847.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Dahliya in bloom is the latest in a recent trend of female led isekai about magical inventions. Honzuki, Tenten Kakumei etc., were all great for me and Dahliya’s no different. While the story isn’t anything to write home about, I really fell in love with Dahliya as a character and enjoyed her personal journey. A cute, smart, independent and badass female lead is my weakness and Dahliya had it all for me. For me the big selling point is Dahliya’s magic device business which usually revolves around implementing common things we have on earth in a fantasy world. She and her father tinkering aroundin a lab for half the season before bringing products to market, and then her doing it on her own later in the series. Seeing a female character whose motivation isn’t romance or chasing after a guy, but building herself up as a businesswoman and exec while growing as a person is so cool. There is a story surrounding Dahliya expanding her business and meeting new business partners, but honestly it’s not that strong. It’s very much a slow burn character story and your enjoyment of the show will hinge on how much you like Dahliya.

I’m also a huge fan of the relationship between the two leads in this one. Instead of it being romantic off rip, Wolf and Dahliya get to know each other, start as friends and continue to deepen their bond over the course of the show. One of the things I hate the most in anime is how characters fall in love with people just because they’re nice to them once or because they smile at them, it’s so cliche and boring honestly. People meet, get to know each other and then take things from there IRL and so seeing that in an anime is always a plus. Additionally, for some plot related reasons Dahliya gets in a toxic situation and seeing her get out of that and start living life on her own terms is way more satisfying than another romance story. I’m sure it’ll come, but when it does it’ll feel earned rather than forced.

The show admittedly doesn’t have the best production values, animation is a little wonky and the character designs range from ok to solid. But it has a cozy charm that’s hard to describe and that drew me in. Dahliya looks cute in most scenes so that’s good enough for me.

Overall this was a great watch for me. I’m biased towards any well written female lead and this was another one of those. It’s a nice recent trend to have and I hope we get more of it. The light novels are doing very well in Japan and since this felt like just the tip of the iceberg for Dahliya’s story I look forward to a season 2 one day.

Dahliya in bloom gets 8 out of 10."
56449,538638.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"tl;dr ""Dahlia in Bloom"" is a low-budget anime with average art and animation, though the character's eyes and emotional expressions stand out. The isekai aspect feels unnecessary, as it doesn't impact the plot at all. The world-building and the magic system, particularly the creation of magical tools, are well-executed. The characters are nice but underdeveloped, especially the side characters. The story starts strong but loses momentum after episode six. If you enjoy shows like ""Ascendance of a Bookworm,"" you might like this one. The review: This anime has a low budget, and despite that, they managed to create something enjoyable. The art is a low-mid tier, the eyes ofthe characters are the only part of the art that is really good and noticeable especially how the emotions are shown through their eyes; and also maybe some foods and the background, it's not bad and not good either, it's just in the middle and sometimes lower. The overall animation feels average at best, and I didn't like that they reused some scenes over and over again, like the leaf on the window, but it's not a big deal so I don't really care. The OST is sometimes noticeable, but not so often, so I can't say good things about it.

The setting especially the isekai part feels unnecessary and useless, I don't understand why they make it as Isekai when it doesn't have any influence on the show at all. Dahlia's past life in Japan is mentioned so briefly that it barely influences the story. The world-building, however, is done well. The magic system is shown in interesting ways, especially the creation of magical tools, which is a strong point of the series.

The characters are slightly above average. While they aren’t fully developed, their personalities are distinct enough to understand and feel them a little. However, I felt that they didn't do just to the side characters as some of them play a really big role in Dahlia's life. The show barely touches on their life and personalities while the characters themselves impact Dahlia a lot.

The story begins strong, steadily building intrigue in the first half of the show. Unfortunately, by episode six, the pacing slows down, and the plot feels like it loses momentum. While the show remains interesting, it lacks the same drive that made the earlier episodes entertaining.

Overall, I enjoyed the show, it's interesting and I didn't feel bored by it. However, some people might get bored by what I find enjoyable. The show focuses mostly on the creation of magical tools and is similar to ""Bookworm"" by the vibes it gives, which is something some people find boring. If you watched ""Bookworm"" and didn't like it, there is a high chance you will not like this show either."
56449,537880.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I've been holding off on writing this review, because I kept fearing this might end up in the weeds. But after the season end, I have to admit I've really enjoyed how the season progressed, and appreciated most of the decisions for the direction the producers took this. I was a little leery with ep 1 and the isekai angle. I saw no real reason for it. It does come into play slighrly, but not like your usual trash isekais. They could have fairly easily made this a fantasy type SoL which is really what it turns out to be. I liked the art overall.It's not knock your socks off, but it is very sweet, colorful and well rendered. Nice background work. I thought the animation was a touch above average for this type of series. There were some shortcuts, but nothing blantantly distracting.

The characters were going to make or break this series, and it all comes out in the wash as very good, indeed. Dahlia is so well written and believable in her conception and protrayal. So well rounded and fleshed out. Other studios should take note on how it's done. It was excellent she didn't descend into some wishy-washy lovelorn schoolgirl once Wolf was debuted. One of the highlights of the writing in this series is neither MC turns into a romantic simp. A realistic platonic relationship grows naturally between the two. So well done, kudos to the writers. While there is some hint at romance. especially in ep 12, its not what drives this narrative.

Even the side characters were well written and portrayed as beyond mere props. And I have to hand it to the entire VA cast for making this series so calm and not unnecessarily dramatic. It's laid back, but with enough activity to keep the narrative moving along at a nice pace. All aspects for a fine job done by the director. 

While I wasn't super impressed at first, this series blossumed into a very satisfying experience. If I was grading, this would get a 87/100 for a B+. If you are into chill character development this is highly recommended. I'd be happy to see this get another season, for sure."
56449,539646.0,3.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Characters are a 1/3 - None of them are annoying but no one notable either. Aside from her love for her father and magical devices and that she's kind, is there anything notable about her? Interesting? Not really. This is what is expected from any anime that at most only has 12 episodes in a season. With so little time, you're never going to get fully fleshed-out characters you can truly feel for. This applies to the FL as well as the ML. Show, don't tell. That's the rule in films and animation. Glimpses of their pain are not enough. You have to immerse youraudience, a 10-second flashback or a 5-second scene of being ogled at isn't sufficient enough for the audience to connect to the characters. Being told ""My friendships keep failing because I'm too handsome"" will never be as impactful as a scene where we can SEE his friendships failing or being ostracized for his looks. 

The story is a 1/3 - I have said in previous reviews I like it when it's Romance &amp; Plot, not Romance = Plot but for this anime? There isn't even romance so what was the point? Don't get me wrong, I like how it's a slow-burn romance where it isn't love at first sight but there was no progress in the magical devices department and the story with her father was about for only four episodes or so. There is no climax. 1 season, sure it's just the beginning of the story but it's still a mini-story on its own and every story has a beginning, climax, and end. Here, it's just beginning. It feels like you got half of the episodes of a full season one then never got the other half. 

Art is a 1/3 - Hey at least the ML is hot (in the panels when the art isn't wonky)

Personal Taster is 0/1."
56449,537862.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"It boils down to a slice-of-life anime in a world where magic is real, but is essentially technology. It's used to imbue items with various effects. Wind and fire magic makes a flamethrower or hair dryer. Ice magic makes a cooler. Fire magic makes a boiler. That type of thing. Dahlia is isekaied after dropping at a young age from overwork - it says something about Japanese culture that so many Manga and Anime share this trope. Her pops is a well known ""artificer"" who has invented numerous magical devices and she's raised by him in a house that's also a workshop and lab, whereher memories from the previous life are inspiration for new devices.

The eisodes cover several months of her life, her friends, and her building relationships. It's an anime anyone can watch.

The animation is average, the voice acting and music are excellent. 90% of the anime is nothing special, then there will be scenes that are incredible - for a few seconds. Usually cut-scenes with unusual angles, different artistic style and so on - the things that made Anime in general so popular in the first place.

I would recommend it for a relaxing watch. There's not much fighting, and seriously - more time is spent discussing foot fungus than actual battles. The relationships are bizarre - almost everyone has commitment issues. You're not going to have all your questions answered. You're just dropping in for a bit to see what's going on."
54284,537996.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I came into Vtuber legend with very little knowledge and frankly any interest in vtubers. I always saw them as weird and something for degenerates, but after watching this show I realised how narrow minded I’d been and how Vtubers are just like any other entertainment source. In fact, they can often resonate with you in ways normal content creators couldn’t. I fell in love with Awayuki from the first episode and this was just nonstop fun. It’s irreverent, hilarious, unapologetically gay af, and wholesome. I really could not ask for more out of this show. One of the biggest surprises of the season forme.

Vtuber legend has a few things that make it a great watch. Firstly, Awayuki is a riot. While she plays things up for her viewers, she is genuinely an amazing character who you can’t help but root for after learning all the adversity she’s had to overcome to get in a position to stream for a living. She brings an authenticity to her streams that really make the show. Yea, the strozero product placement can be a little over the top at times, but generally I think seeing her get drunk and being herself and vulnerable with her fans was a fun experience. 

The other big thing for me is Awayuki’s relationship with her other vtubers. This is the best part of the show and I died laughing on several occasions seeing the collab streams. The story also doesn’t stray away from being unapologetically Yuri which is another big plus. Awayuki and a couple characters have some obvious romantic tension and I’m not just talking your usual bait confession, but legitimate feelings that characters talk about openly. Things definitely go hard on the 18+ side with sex toy references and other degenerate stuff, but it’s not like goonbait, it’s just lesbians being horny and I found that refreshing. Girls get horny too and there’s nothing wrong with talking about it! The skits and collab streams get increasingly unhinged as the season progresses, but I thoroughly enjoyed them all. The vtubers all have really unique personalities and diverse streaming styles just like irl so there’s someone and something for everyone in this one. 

Vtuber Legend manages to keep you feeling very immersed thanks to the fact the characters are portrayed as being in their vtuber outfits the whole time, so it’s like you’re in the computer with them while they’re streaming if that makes sense. It’s done in an effort to preserve the feeling that they’re real people not just personas. It definitely hit for me. I felt myself wishing that Awayuki was real on more than one occasion throughout this. The amount of money I’d give her would be astonishing.. 

Vden is very much an otaku culture show. There’s a tons of references to other aspects of otaku culture, anime, visual novels and other media. But it’s also a series that people who don’t even necessarily like vtubers can get into. Despite having almost no working knowledge of vtubers this was one of my favourite shows of the year and I’ll miss it!

Vden gets a very easy 10/10"
54284,538158.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Note: I’m not into Vtuber culture, but I can recognize and understand some things about it mainly because they are so popular it’s basically impossible to escape them if you’re into otaku culture as they pretty much are a part of it, so I’m not going to be biased for it. This anime is an advertisement for the Strong Zero beer- uh, I mean, it’s about a Vtuber breaking character and getting popular because of it as the title says. I'm surprised no one pointed out inside the show the little comments that are in the streams, because this show follows how Vtubers work, they evendid their own live2D models of the characters for the show and use them from time to time where they could simply use regular animation all the time. While it also shows them outside of streamings, they usually don't change from how they look in their avatars, I could be cynical and say that it is to keep the illusion that Vtubers are still their personas outside of streams or that the studio was lazy and couldn't bother doing designs for how they should really look, but it is pretty obviously none of those, it’s because the show isn't focused on that, this isn't a show that has Vtubers on it, it’s a show about the Vtubers.

This show is pretty silly, it’s a complete slice of life show where you don't have to expect a plot, the characters can change a little in their relationships but it never goes to a point where you'll miss much, as it is basically a collection of streams which I guess most if not all are based on streams made by actual Vtubers and you'll probably see some characters and say that they remind you of some Vtuber you know. It’s also one of those anime where the comedy can vary a lot in quality, but it will never reach a point where you will be laughing a lot from them, if you understand the culture you will surely be able to enjoy it more, because the moments that landed the most for me was stuff like in that episode where they shouted ""MAKOTO"" and then showed the ""nice boat"", or the episode where they were playing an online card game where the studio even made an entire small animation for Rias Gremory and references to other TNK anime which I watched and loved, I mean, TNK animating Rias Gremory in the year 2015+9? I didn't even remember the last time they animated her, while other jokes are as bad as the adult baby fetish ones which I can only guess is one of the fetishes the author has as it had two episodes on it. If for some weird reason you were expecting something about the ""dark side"" of vtubing or anything of the sort here, then you aren't watching the right anime, there are some darker moments like Awayuki being forced to drink to keep capitalizing on her new drunk persona or when they doxed her, but those are played as comedy sketches that don't impact the characters or the setting much.

I can't understand why Vtubers are so popular, if anything they remind me that when I was like 12 there were some YouTubers that would do Let’s Play videos that my classmates would talk about, I never got into those because 1) I wasn't interested in that 2) I didn't have Wi-Fi back then, so watching things on YouTube was pretty difficult, so I wouldn't be able to do it even if I was interested. The only difference I can see from Vtubers to Let’s Players is that these are behind cute anime girl avatars, and it's not like I didn't try to watch things from them, I remember when I tried watching one of those Vtubers stream, I watched it for like 10 minutes or so, and while I guess it wasn't so bad, I just cannot possibly get what would be so interesting about watching it for hours to get all the popularity they have right now. If anything I'm surprised this anime isn't more popular given it’s about Vtubers, something extremely popular nowadays to the point of dominating the Comiket just behind a plague like Blue Archive, but this show doesn't even get much fanart, I guess it would be because Vtuber fans aren't even interested in anime or they could just watch their Vtuber instead of watching an anime about completely original Vtuber personas, or maybe the overlap of fanbases just isn't as strong as one would think, as Vtubers are much more similar to watching any other streamer than watching anime. If anything, this show is about what Vtubers can only dream to be, actual anime girls.

It's not like I could expect TNK to do this anime, they are one of the only studios that can constantly put out good ecchi anime and they don't do many works per year despite not having impressive animation or anything, so I can just wonder why they chose a light novel about Vtubers to adapt it, I could be disappointed on it as there are other ecchi shows that aired alongside this one like 2.5 getting censored, however, the reason why I'm not really disappointed is because you can see that they really were having fun doing this show, it surely won't change your opinions about Vtubers but you can see how much they appreciate the culture and the last episode is pretty much a testament to that.

Thank you for reading."
54284,538193.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"A love letter to the Vtuber industry, even for those outside the industry, like me. The first chapter is the key because it shows the type of humor that it will handle, which is one heavily based on sexual humor and jokes. Basically, the question is whether the anime could stay fresh with humor that gets old too quickly. Still, the subsequent chapters show you that sexual humor is only one weapon in its arsenal. It knows how to balance it very well with other resources such as tsukkomi humor, serious moments, and references to franchises or other Vtubers. The anime puts all its weight onthe protagonist, who has to lead all the scenes and sketches, whether in a main role or in a more secondary role. The idea of ​​such a varied cast with different personalities helps our protagonist to be able to play many roles, not just the comedic one.

Vtuber Nandaga is an anime that doesn't stand out in its animation, but it's still not afraid to be proactive. It constantly uses different types of animation and camera framing. It's not afraid to experiment with various animation styles within a single episode. There are a couple of ideas that feel very fresh, like the fairy tale-style animation or the vertical framing to simulate the view from a cell phone.

The negative aspect to review is the issue that a person outside the world of Vtubers or streams in general, can feel overwhelmed with the scenes of the interaction between the chat and the Vtuber. Many of the jokes are heavily recharged in the chat of the streams. Since they move too fast, you may have to pause if you want to know what they are saying or simply ignore it and miss a small, big part of the experience.

Personally, the connection I made with Awayuki Kokorone is one that I will take beyond this season. It made me enter a comfort zone that is too big. This anime has definitely become one of my safe places. Between all the jokes, sketches, and songs, I feel like when I'm going through a bad time, I can always tune into an Awayuki Kokorone stream."

HAPPY VEIWING EXPERIENCE"
54284,538052.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Personally, I feel like the biggest criticism I see for this show, being its plot/story, is hardly an issue in the grand scheme of it all. Sure, there's not a lot going on- each episode (if I recall correctly) features a stream with Awayuki, whether it's one of her own or her collaborating with other Live-On members. But those make for a comedic, lighthearted viewing experience to take the viewer along her journey as a VTuber. While it won't get overly profound, the show does hit home on its big themes of self-acceptance, and surrounding yourself with friends who will be there for you everystep of the way. It's a very heartwarming watch, with beautiful animation and adorable characters. I did find it genuinely very funny, but I also understand not everyone shares the same sense of humor, so take that as you will.

If you have even the slightest interest in VTubers, and want an easygoing, silly anime to watch, then give it a try. It's cute!"
54284,538147.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I understand a lot of VTubing culture and I have a few friends who do this as well. This show depicts a lot of things that are true within the space. After watching it all, I have more respect for the people who do it and my friends who try their hardest to stream. This is suppose to be a review so let’s start that now. This might be one of my favorites this whole year. I like how they actually use Live2D models (VTuber Models) in some episodes which gave it a genuine feel of watching someone live. Despite being an anime, it felt realisticwatching and I’m learning more about the VTubing culture. In the last episode the concert they held felt like an actual VTuber concert too. (I’ve seen some and honestly might be better than some) It was cute, funny, and wholesome but the production and what this show is felt real because it showed aspects of what VTubing actually is. It’s not 100% accurate but I can tell they actually took the time to learn and tried to give us somewhat a real feel to it. 

If you don’t know what VTubing is I’d recommend watching it and if you do, you’re going to love this and have more love for your oshis. 

Also, for the people who don’t, I hope you enjoy this and start watching VTubers in the future!"
54284,540350.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I came across this anime while looking for somthing Mindless To put on while I cleaned my room, and GOD IT DIDN'T DISAPPOINT. Vtuber Legend is one of the best Comedy anime I've Watched. It definitely wont appeal to everyone's sense of humour but if you like some Mindless Sex jokes and Raunchy humour your in for a good time. It's been a long time since any anime has managed to make me laugh as much as this one. I also really appreciate an anime that can have an incredibly lewd script and dialouge without shoving unnecessary fanservice in your face. Aside from one very specificscene which gets a pass for context and it's censored anyway.

I wont pretend to be a big Vtuber fan but I tune in to a couple every once and a while and I think this anime does a suprisingly good job portraying a streamer. Somthing in fiction thats always bothered me is how you can always tell that whoever wrote the script for a streamer character has never watched a live stream in their life. But you can tell the author of this series is very well versed in Vtuber Culture and does an amazing job at creating natural feeling yet incredibly entertaining conversations between it's main cast of streamers.

I definitely think that this is a musr watch for any Vtuber fan or anyone looking for a anime that will make them laugh out loud. Give it 2 Episodes, if the comedy isn't your style then you wont be missing much by dropping it.


-SPOILERS AHEAD YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED-




I'd also like to point out that this show has a cameo from Rias Gremory from Highschool DxD which caught me so off guard I had to watch the scene 10 times and send it to my girlfreind who questioned how I ever manged to pull."
54284,539661.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"I don't really understand Vtuber culture so I can't judge accurately because this is a really new show in anime. But I will judge logically according to my perspective. So from the storyline telling about a Vtuber who became very famous because of his unintentional negligence but was liked by his fans and colleagues, basically it only tells about his daily life along with his professional activities which are spiced up with sexual humor that tends more towards shojo ai. It takes patience to be able to enjoy this anime because you will be faced with a lot of chat interactions between characters and NPCsaka audiences which are sometimes just like a chat panel on social media which is quite difficult to follow because it passes so quickly, especially if we have to translate it into a language that we understand. It will be very troublesome and boring because you have to pause this anime video often in order to understand the storyline.  And this should be an anime that tells the real Vtuber culture but I can't see it or distinguish it because there is no difference between the Vtuber character and the real character, the only difference is the presence of 2.5D animated characters, and it doesn't explain the reference for making Vtuber characters whether from the original appearance of the real character or just the imagination of the character creator in the story, and the lack of the appearance of NPCs that are not related to the story are only depicted with markers that are not similar to human appearance, maybe this is just my prejudice that considers it as the uniqueness of this anime's background. 

So my conclusion for this anime, it is unique in some senses but not impressive enough to make me interested in Vtuber culture, maybe the advantages of this anime are only a place for voice actors to improve their skills by imitating some unique characters in this anime."
54284,538091.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"After watching the final episode made me feel like it was a pretty damn good anime overall with some cathartic moments, I surprised myself on how good I thought it was. I was originally set on giving this a 6/10, but after sitting back, I realized that as someone who's never been into VTuber culture, nor watched a single VTuber, the amount of fun I had watching all episodes of this anime made me feel like I owe it to this anime to bump my rating to a 7, maybe even an 8. The humor was good, the personalities of each characters was so vibrant.Each one of them felt unique and offered something different to the table. And while I don't watch VTubers, various media references every now and then I can still understand, especially that episode where they played the multiplayer whodunit game, which I personally relate, as I rode that wave back in 2020 as well with Among Us. 

Even the sometimes serious side of this anime was a nice icing on the cake. Awayuki and Mashiro's episode was genuinely heartwarming, and so was the final episode. I know how much impact ""graduating"" VTubers has towards its audience, as I sometimes catch wind of that in my social media feeds every now and then.

Production side of things, it was serviceable. Not good, not bad. Oddly enough, while the anime used some 3D especially in the final episode, it didn't feel ""out of place"" at all, probably owing to the CGI nature of VTubers. 

I had thought that the idea of VTubers was something I'd never understand. I found the idea of watching a digital avatar play/do something while only seeing the avatar's responses in 2D weird, but now I get it.

I probably still wouldn't watch VTubers on my own, as gaming, reading, and watching anime will still always be my top hobbies, and I feel like I grew out of my ""watch streamers play games"" phase years ago, but if I ever get the pleasure, I probably wouldn't mind watching clips pass by my feed every now and then. 

As for this anime, if there ever is a Season 2 (though with the way this ended, it feels unlikely, which is sad), you can bet I'll watch it.

Overall, I recommend this anime, even as someone who aren't into VTuber culture. You can just think of it as a comedy anime (well it is, but targeted towards those who are into VTubers) where humor is pretty good that you'll understand it even without the complete context. Perhaps you'll miss some references here and there (I have missed a lot), but it won't impact your overall viewing experience, as this is first and foremost a character-driven story about a certain VTuber and its colleagues before it's a story about VTuber culture in general."
54284,538501.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Like 'My Deer Friend Nokotan,' it is one of those shows that you will appreciate if you get the references. But if not, it depends on you liking the VTuber main character. The premise is simple. Kokorone Awayuki was a struggling VTuber. She quit the job that she hates in order to be a VTuber, but it looks like being one ain't no different. For three months, she wasn't making any progress. Until one day, she forgot to stop streaming. So from the demure persona she was projecting, she got drunk and the world saw her real personality, someone who is unhinged. And the restis the story of this anime.

It's a hit or miss, and I am scoring this low because it's more often than not a miss as far as I'm concerned. There's really no plot to talk about. This is just random VTubers doing their own thing that may or may not be funny. 

Some episodes are a bit enjoyable but more often than not, it is too random that the main draw is the banter. Perhaps you need some knowledge of Japanese to appreciate this, as well as being into VTuber culture. It's not something that invites those not knowledgeable of VTubers to watch real VTubers. It assumes that you already like them. For people in the latter case, they would likely score this high, but for most people, this would be a turd.

If you cannot follow the references, this show will be mainly carried by the drunk personality of Awayuki, named Shuwa. It was fun at the beginning, but it quickly got old. It's also a season-long commercial for Strong Zero, which might annoy some.

Another thing going for it is that it reflects current otaku culture with all the new terms associated with it. This may interest some but I doubt it's enough to recommend this."

It's obvious they just wanted a show where they could throw ""VTuber"" into the title for clicks, but didn't have any plan for the overall show.

Story: 1/10 2. Characters: 7/10 3. Art/Animation: 8/10 5. Voice-over: 8/10My reasons why this anime should not have been airing:
1. Story
2. Story
3. Story

The first episode was perfect, and because of it, everyone was excited about the anime. However, gradually, the story started to turn into the streams only that Kokorone makes and how Live-On's streamers cooperate with each other to make more fun streams. The story till now feels exciting, right? The problem starts from the second episode when I'm surprised that the anime only talks about streams so there are barely any scenes outside the limits of Kokorone's streams or her friends from the same company, then the anime becomes repetitive in addition to the lack of any goal from watching it because you do not know what Kokorone's goal is or what she wants to achieve?

Although the rating based on the numbers I put above should be 6, I will give it 3 because anime should first and foremost be based on a good story."

The dirty joke is fine by me but they didnt deliver it nicely and it become nothing but empty talk, it wasnt funny or anything, what a waste.

The animation and design for this anime is great, i have nothing to say about it.

All and all, even for someone like me who love watching a group of girls doing their things without romantic genre involve, this one is bad.

If you havent watch, please dont waste your time, just go watch other anime, there are tons of good anime out there like Bang Dream! or Idolmaster, Yurucamp, Encouragement of Climb, even the current season anime 'Narenare -Cheer for You!-' is not so bad."

The whole drama came about it’s because of Rumi. At first she confessed to the MC and won the battle. After 1 year of dating, she decided to break up with him cos she felt ""pity"" towards Naori. Just so u know Naori dgaf when they are dating. But this Rumi decided to break up and ask the MC to get together with Naori. Without even thinking how the MC would feel, she just like ""Ohlet’s break up, it’s on me, not you"" LOL

When Naori wanted to go after the MC, Rumi suddenly felt jealous and wanted to take him back. WHAT?! U had him but decided to break up and now u chasing after him again after knowing Naori decided to take the MC. What a retard. 
 
I can’t explain how i hate the MC too for being so stupid. Imagine still chasing after a girl that dumped you without a valid reason. Naori love the MC so bad that she willing to do anything for him yet this dumb MC be like ""I like you but i like Rumi too"" smhhh"
55996,538336.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Love Is Indivisible by Twins - A Kiss x Sis and/or Yosuga no Sora derivative this is not…or more so like a younger version of Domestic na Kanojo a.k.a Domestic Girlfriend, but in the most offensive and nonsensical way ever. In the game of love, romance interchanges between multiple people are a thing, no matter what direction it goes, so much so that we label this a love polygon. And trust me, if you see one instance of said theme, it's a given that it will not end well (anyone who's old enough to remember the clusterfish that was the White Album series, especially White Album2?). Though there're the anomalies who use this trope to deliver amicable resolutions (see this season's rom-com masterpiece of Make Heroine ga Oosugiru! a.k.a MakeIne: Too Many Losing Heroines!) to a great degree. Everything else, just like the obvious butt-of-the-joke series that is Kanojo, Okarishimasu a.k.a Rent-A-Girlfriend, is always bound to be doomed because of its excessive push for romance in the most uncomfortable of ways, and from the courtesy of novelist Shihon Takamura's sole series that is Koi wa Futago de Warikirenai a.k.a Love Is Indivisible by Twins, which started in May 2021, this is a rom-com so obnoxious that it literally answers the love polygon equation in a melodramatic trainwreck of a manner so dumb and messy that you start to question what was the intention to begin with.

Story? Ha, what story, it's just the premise of a boy living alongside a pair of fraternal twin sisters who moved in as next-door neighbours when they were children, making the trio essentially childhood friends who hung out together, even towards their high school years, when the flutterings of the heart begin to slowly take over the twin sisters' hearts enough to want to date the boy who grew up with them. The one BIG problem: they don't know how to navigate their affectionate love around the love polygon so much that it's a give-and-take situation of a weird relationship, aside from living together like a close-knit family. It's a shitshow of a masterpiece if you consider getting your hands dirty to sully relationships that could either go down the sole boy-girl route, or, like Kiss X Sis, embrace both sisters the way they are without complicating their feelings for the same guy...which this series just doesn't get the formula right.

To judge this fairly, let's step back to understand the love polygon a bit more. The Jinguji twin sisters of Rumi and Naori, as different as they are on the outside, are also different on the inside. The rather pompous sister of Rumi is an extroverted character, boasting a tomboyish personality, and is a member of their school's basketball club, so between the sisters, you will find that Rumi is often more engaged with her friends that's either from class or club, being the social butterfly that she is, and even worthy of being girlfriend material. The latter twin sister of Naori is an introvert who loves all things Otaku, from popular movies to books, and even gets along with the young man's father quite nicely to keep him engaged in the conversation for as long as they can. And the young man himself, Jun Shirosaki, who is in all literacy, an average Joe of a guy who loves life but doesn’t know how to reciprocate towards romance being an airheaded guy who can’t make decisive choices (that at least thankfully doesn’t exude Kazuya-type levels of simp), actually gets fancied by Naori first and even confesses to him during their junior high school years. Yet, it was Rumi who stole that position first and dated Jun like any other non-blood-related childhood friend ""sibling"" will do, without a care in the world, and then realized the error in her ways to break up with him to respect and not interfere against her other twin sister's feelings for Jun.

That in and of itself should already be the end of its tribulations...but guess what? Rumi, even after letting Naori have her way with Jun, suddenly finds herself wanting more of the young man than ever before, so much so as to do the ONE thing that she should not have done from the start: the breakup. It's truly a matter of complicated feelings as their classmates-cum-close friends of Toyoshige Moriwaki, Reira Asano, Ririsu Kamedake, and Rumi's model friend of Shiena Amamiya have to witness their back-and-forth love triangle, with all friends on all 3 sides of the triangle contemplating and supporting with their ""brother and sister"" energy on the trio to see who he or she will eventually end up with. I'm not gonna lie, this dumpster fire of a 3-way relationship should be easy to resolve, but Shihon Takamura clearly knew what he/she could've done more with the series to cook some Rent-A-Girlfriend-type overblown melodrama that'll get people talking, because drama clearly creates the craving for attention in order to milk the series until someone stops the fiasco to own up the relationship and make things right. For sure, this is a love triangle that'll leave the audience mostly fuming in confusion and disbelief of why, what, and how this dysfunctional relationship even works in the first place. And it succeeded in the romance being sacrificial to the overall love triangle plot. For better or for worse, you decide.

The production values and animation actually look pretty good, if a touch too bright and almost to the point of oversaturation. If you're thinking that this could come from any of the competent studios like Doga Kobo or defunct iconics the likes of Xebec (which had been absorbed into Sunrise in 2019), you're almost right. This is studio ROLL2's first-ever anime production, and for a completely new studio on its first rodeo, this show looks better than the sum of the many diverse contemporaries, and it has good animation to boot. Definitely looking forward to seeing what this rather small, fledgling no-name studio will serve us next with.

I thought that the OST was kind of nice, at least for a trash-worthy love polygon series like this. Naori’s VA Maaya Uchida always has a way to compose some rather nice Anisongs over the years, and “Parallel na Heart” is bussin’ all the right textures for a catchy OP song that it’s hard to put down. Alongside the OP, her and Rumi’s VA for the ED of “Honey Citron” is also a nice, upbeat song, though its other cousin of the “Strings Arrange” version is the one that I fancy all the more with the slow and melancholic feels. Moreover, with Rumi’s VA of rookie Seiyuu Moeha Nochimoto, the female MC serves as her very first role for a MC, which, despite all the negative jargon for the basis of her rather wishy-washy character, I thought she nailed it pretty well, and sounded like most established Seiyuus in the anime industry that you couldn’t tell any difference at all for a fresh new face.

When all is said and done, if you need a trashy and irredeemable love triangle, Koi wa Futago de Warikirenai a.k.a Love Is Indivisible by Twins, has got you covered in more ways than one. The unfortunate TL;DR is this: melodrama will always inevitably cave in into conflict, and especially for a love triangle where you’ll expect some mutual respect to be had, the human heart just simply doesn’t work that way. And like the Jinguji twin sisters, one’s a Lawful Good who just wants to have fun and do whatever the hell she wants to do, while the other’s a Chaotic Evil who considers, and reconsiders after the deed is done, not knowing what to do next to be filled with even more confusion being a “family-with-benefits” type of person. I guess when you have the word “indivisible” in the title, the love and affection may be the same, but the execution is just frankly a mess, almost toxic to the point where regrets will fill in after wrongdoings that’ll affect the person or the people around. But on the upside, this mess somehow just propagates the love-hate guilt-trip that just induces you to watch further, so much so that “it’s so bad, it’s (not) good"".

If you have the pension for messy teenage dramas of the youthful size of DomeKano, this anime would be a good one to add to your list. Otherwise, there’re just better rom-coms out there (heck, this Summer 2024 season has a few good ones too) that’ll gladly serve your finite time better."
55996,538437.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"An absolute masterpiece This anime is a true gem, filled with intricate details and unexpected twists. The first surprise is that Jun has to choose between the sisters, and it’s not a simple “why not both?” scenario. This sets the stage for a fierce and dirty competition between the sisters to be the chosen one. The sisters’ personalities are a bit of a twist on what you might expect. Naori, the otaku, is extroverted, quirky, and full of confidence, while Rumi, the athletic and popular girl, is more passive and indecisive. Jun could potentially be with both, as he is perfectly fine following whatever Naori comes upwith, sharing more hobbies with her. However, his more…

I can’t wait for the next season! The characters are well-developed, and the plot is full of unexpected turns. Each episode kept me on the edge of my seat, and I am eagerly anticipating what happens next. This anime is a must-watch for anyone who loves a good mix of romance, drama, and competition."
55996,538345.0,2.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Every season, there's always gonna be an anime which is absolutely underwhelming, probably even worse than garbage. And that anime, my fellow readers, is none other than Koi wa Futago de Warikirenai, or Love is Indivisible by Twins. Let's talk briefly about the plot - it's dull, confusing and stressful. This anime is about twins' love rivalry towards a boy (which is the main character), and oh boy... what am I even watching? The male MC can't even decide which girl he wants to date, despite liking them both. The twins' characteristics are very devastating, too. We have a girl who had dated him for ayear and saying that she doesn't deserve to be his girlfriend; we also have a girl who likes him, but keeps on denying their relationship, stated that they're not dating despite kissing him every episode, and seducing him. Honestly speaking, most of the episodes are literally fillers, which is unsuitable for a 12-episode anime. Thus, it made this anime very mundane as it turned to a slice-of-life high school anime (with dramas), which undoubtedly distorted the genre/plot of the anime. You might be wondering, why can't he just date both of them, right? Well, if he does that, then the drama of this horrendous anime won't even happen. 


Speaking of drama, ...


This anime's genre is rated as a rom-com - which clearly stands for romantic comedy. To be fairly speaking, I can't even count how many times I've laid out a chuckle, or even a smile. Why? Because I didn't even laugh on their ""funny moments"". And speaking of ""funny moments"", there aren't any 🙃. This anime has a crap ton of unnecessary dramas which can make you question life. 



And the worst part is? There is zero progression. The male MC did not even date any of the twins, despite saying ""I love you both."" to both of them, in front of their faces. This would actually make you question the existence of this poorly-written anime.



To conclude, please DO NOT watch this anime. Don't even bother checking this anime out. There are better, actual rom-com animes available out there. That's all from me. Thanks for reading this!

About the animation and character design, nothing to say, they were good although with such a trashy plot it had to have at least decent animation, and the seiyuus, well, nothing to say either, they were very good... And professionals who want to continue making this anime.

55996,540619.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I haven't bothered to write reviews about things I've seen yet, but I'm so flabbergasted at the reception to this show that I felt compelled to do so. After trying out the show on a whim, I found it so well-crafted and compelling that I was certain it was some sort of sleeper hit, and when I checked MAL, I found this dismal rating for it. I guess it's one of those cases where I just don't get what other people are thinking. What I love the most about this show is that the characters have deeply-developed personalities. You don't get--wait, let me amend that, becauseapparently my view is somehow a minority one. I, personally, don't get the sense that the characters are just there to serve one-note roles. They can't be described with a summary one-liner. They often start going on about things they're interested in, when those things aren't there simply for the sake of moving the plot forward. Like even with the background family characters--you just find yourself in the middle of a scene where they're talking about the WW2 aircraft they appreciate. Why? It has nothing to do with the plot, and that particular discussion is never referenced again. It's there to give you a sense that these are people living their lives, with their own things going on, not just performing a scene for the sake of the viewer. And I love that. It makes the world as it's presented feel so rich. It's exactly the sort of thing that I see in real life, that makes me feel like I'm with people I can get along with. People who have passion, and opinions, and just find joy in expressing themselves through their interests.

And that's something that permeates this show. It's not once or twice, it's simply how every scene is presented. Naori can hardly have a conversation without talking in terms she's used to--references to the stuff she's read or watched. And that just feels like...a real person to me. The interplay between her and Jun reminds me so much of how I was growing up, talking to my friends in terms of Star Wars or whatnot. That stuff was what we oriented our lives around. Usually, characters like that in anime are handled as one-dimensional otaku, obsessed with one particular made up thing and having it be played off for laughs. But instead, here, it's just integrated into who the characters are; everything flows naturally as a result, and you actually see why people are friends. Instead of merely being told that they are and accepting it as a conceit of a TV show. Normally, characters are some platonic ideal, or at the heart of some unimaginable struggle, but here we have characters grounded in the mere complexity of human experience. I just love that sense that they have lives beyond what we see on screen.

Even Jun's friend, who basically is there to be a sounding board or point out how we the viewer might feel about the situations Jun finds himself in, nevertheless feels like a developed person with his own values and wants and personality. A lot of this is handled by the realistic and rapid pacing of the dialogue. TV shows usually take the approach of giving each line its own space to breathe, so everything is easily digested. But the conversations in this show are paced more like you'd expect from high school kids--they're excitable, they want to get their words out, they nearly talk over each other. It again makes things feel more real and engaging, and less like a performance being put on for an audience. I love this aspect of the show so much, and wish it were more common. But back to the character of ""the Professor"", his inclusion is pretty critical to lampshade some of the things the audience is thinking, and give Jun a chance to explain why the situation isn't so rosy from his point of view. I've seen in a lot of the reviews that people get ""annoyed"" at the conflict in the show and don't get why it isn't resolved simply. And I just don't get how you can actually watch the show, which gives the characters a chance to explain why they can't, and come away with that impression. But nevertheless, people seem to.

I also love all the references in the show; I feel like I get around 70% of them myself, and they're again not played up for the audience--the characters just make them and move on, because that's what people do. No background splashes to drive the point home. One of the few examples of non-diegetic presentation for a reference was in the last episode with the Close Encounters notes sounding when Naori does the accompanying hand signals, but it was pretty subtle. It's never in your face; the references are there because people like these characters would make them. Not to try to simply grab the attention of fans of the referenced works. I honestly get a better sense of ""these people are actual geeks"" than I do from, say, Genshiken. And I feel that's saying a lot.

The plot starts out the way it does in a lot of romance shows, where there's a romantic conflict. I've seen reviewers tear down Rumi for the actions she takes, not understanding why she would do ""stupid"" things and bring on a world of hardship for herself. And again...I don't get why people have that takeaway, when the show lets her explain it in great detail. To me, it seems like something that could happen. They don't have simple, black-and-white relationships. Everything is realistically complex. Siblings have love for each other, and also conflict with one another. They seek to back each other up as family, but can tick each other off simply by how they approach situations differently. This is, again, a realistic thing. I feel like the audience seems to be upset that the characters don't fit conveniently into little boxes. But people don't fit into little boxes. They have conflicting feelings all the time. And sometimes they do a bit of self-sabotage as a result. And sometimes they don't realize what impact inaction can have until it's too late. This show gets that, and it gets that in a way few other anime do. Perhaps in a way few anime fans do, going by the score.

The main minus to me, which I can't go into much detail about, is the rather inconclusive ending. I don't know if the LN goes beyond what we've seen; I don't know if we're to expect another season. If the story is continued, then that's not even much of a downside. But it's also unclear where it would go; the choices the characters have made give them few options for resolution, and the sort of non-ending we get is the only thing that clearly follows. Not to say there's nothing else that could be said; all kinds of developments could occur, relationships with other people and so on, which could really shake up the status quo. It just doesn't have a clear vector of momentum at the end, so further developments would be completely up in the air, or in fact this might be the best ending we could get.

On the technical side, I love all the visuals in this show. The characters are drawn and animated with a lot of detail. The opening animation is very engaging. I love the ending theme (and especially, that the song is presented in two versions to best accompany the mood). The voice direction is top-notch, as implied by my prior comments on the conversational pacing. I really feel that everyone involved put their heart into this show, and I really enjoyed it.

Maybe this just isn't a show for a lot of people. But for the people who get it, it's fantastic. And I'm just tired of seeing the dogpile that happened here by people who, I guess, were expecting more of a typical lighthearted romcom full of tropes and stock characters."

With well-developed characters, the narrative captures the essence of young love while examining the unique challenges faced by those who are closely connected yet distinctly different. Overall, this tale resonates with anyone who has ever grappled with the complexities of love, making it a memorable and thought-provoking read."
55996,538338.0,6.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"If you’re looking for one of the dumbest romcom casts, look no further. Futakire is one of the most disappointing shows in recent memory for me. I spent weeks bragging on how good this series was and how the characters all communicated and acted like normal people, just for it to make a liar out of and completely embarrass me by devolving into a convoluted mess of repetitive idiocy. It’s one of the few romance shows where no one deserves to win because of how stupid they all act. Seriously, the only thing these kids deserve is a gift card to Chuck E Cheese. Thegaslighting, emotional abuse, mind games etc., just wore on me in this one and made me want to turn the TV off. Rumi was the only shining diamond in this hideous, stinky rough.

First few episodes of Futakire had me on cloud 9. I thought the twins crushing on the same guy trope was cool and while we’d seen it in KissxSis, it looked like it was going to be more mature and substantive in this one. Boy was I wrong. The twins, Naori and Rumi basically pass the MC, Jun around like an emotional toy that they can pick up at their convenience. They both date and break up with him at various points out of the interest of the other sister, and then regret it/try to get back with Jun only for him to realise he now likes the other etc. If it sounds cheesy and poorly written, well you’re right it is. Be glad you didn’t have to watch it. After about episode 5, all the communication that I liked from the start was gone. The characters start telling half truths or not being honest with their feelings and it was just tiring. I get that you have to have a degree of drama in these stories for it to be interesting, but there’s better ways to create it. For example, having Rumi set up a date purely because she wants Jun to tell her not to go on it and make him jealous is just comically bad writing. There’s a ton of other examples I could go over, but if for some reason you want to subject yourself to watching this, I don’t want to spoil it. Jun himself comes off as an indecisive loser. I mean, falling in love with two twins is one thing but expecting them to wait on you to make up your mind over which you want to be with is another. He doesn’t even have any cool traits where you’d be like “ah yea that makes sense why girls love him”. He’s your generic looking seasonal protagonist who happens to be a little book smart, big whoop, not worth losing sleep over. 

I can’t lie though, I did really like Rumi. I think she’s very cute and even though she started doing some stupid stuff at the end of the series, I still think she’s the best fit for the MC and the only person who makes him grow. Her sister on the other hand, Naori, is one of my most despised characters this year. Absolute snake of a character whose only purpose in the story is goonbait and sowing discord. Every scene she was in just made my stomach turn, her manipulation of Jun and her sister was so gross and I just found her to be a very hard to watch character. They mask her nastiness with this quirky “I’m an otaku and love all the same stuff as Jun”’gimmick but it didn’t move me at all. Yea, she has a lot in common with the MC, but that doesn’t necessarily make you a good fit for a person. Sometimes opposites attract and challenge you to grow more than staying in your comfort zone.

Production wise the show is meh. Animation is subpar and character models look wonky at times. I do think Rumi and Naori character design wise are cute, but they have a lot of off model frames that look really bad. I didn’t notice it as much at the start because the story was so good, but as time went on I definitely noticed it more and more. 

So what’s the verdict, is this worth a watch? I’d say if you want to laugh at some of the dumbest characters in the medium, or just want to appreciate Rumi, go for it. It’s not the worst show in the world and I did enjoy it to a certain degree even after it went downhill, but it’s just so frustrating. There’s ways you can make a sibling love triangle story like this interesting and this, at least what we’ve seen in the anime so far, was not it.

Futakire gets 6 out of 10."
55996,538342.0,5.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"The 3 episode rule just doesn't apply to this show since episode 1 is just amazing and sets the mood and expectations for something that this just really isn't. It gets you hooked in hopes of living up to the early episodes but it just won't, it's downhill after episode 1. Episode 1 proves they can do drama well, so it just makes the whole show seem effortless. The early episodes (especially episode 1) are so drama packed it makes you think that the comedy tag is supposed to be drama. But it's not like that. The whole show is fueled solely by the MC beingindecisive and nothing else. I don't mind when a romance anime relies on obliviousness of the characters, but this takes it to a new level. It's almost comedic that the show ends on the same note with no proper ending.

Oh also, comedy. It's barely there, even by romcom standards it's just meh. There's good gag humor here and there or funny teasing sometimes, but you won't remember this show for being funny or recall a single memorable funny scene.

I wish I could say nice things about the characters but the MC doesn't have any development besides coming to terms with his feelings (or the lack of it) that were obvious from the beginning. The twins do have some development, but can't say that it's for the better, but at least it makes the show something instead of nothing.

To simply put my disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined. Even though the show established itself as annoying and pointless around halfway through, I still expected more of an ending. Watch at your own discretion."
56196,539990.0,6.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Recommended - with caveats. The 4th, and possibly final My Hero Academia film asks an interesting question - what if someone with twisted ideals felt the calling to fill the void All Might left behind? A man who mysteriously looks like All Might appears in Japan with an entourage of powerful sidekicks and a fancy flying ship, declares to the world he will take up his mantle, and things kick off from there. What follows is what we've come to expect from MHA movies - Class 1A & company taking on a villain with world-ending calamitous powers not seen before. We also get two new movie-only allies- Anna, our damsel in distress, and Giulio, her loyal butler and protector, on a mission to save her, for better or worse.

This film is almost two hours long but has a lot going for it if you're a fan of classic MHA character dynamics and action. Taking place in the throes of season 6, Japan is already a disaster zone, so any more destruction might as well be a drop in the bucket. Despite that, the film does a good job balancing bombastic fight sequences with a meaningful story - as meaningful as a story that can't affect the anime timeline can be, anyway.

Where the 2nd and 3rd films struggled to find this zen, ""You're Next"" feels more akin to ""Two Heroes"", the 1st film that came at what was likely the peak of MHA fandom, and is still arguably the best of the four.

While there is certainly exhaustion and weariness over MHA as its manga has ended with mixed opinions, if you still like the characters and the universe of MHA, there's enough here for fans - and possibly former fans - to entertain for its nearly 2 hour runtime. Otherwise, I don't think there is much here for anyone else, as the film isn't deep or nuanced enough to stand on its own. Not that it had to, but it does accomplish what it set out to do and land on its two feet in the end on an emotional high.

A shounen movie that has to exist between the pages of its parent story can only accomplish so much. There is certainly some missed potential here, but only for those reasons. The film plays to its strengths and has fun with its premise. For that, it deserves credit."
56196,540364.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"A great movie that fans will really like. I think bystanders or friends who tag along with their MHA besties will probably not really get it, but I think they can still enjoy it if they are keen to anime. The action is so intense and prominent throughout this entire movie that if you have to get up to go pee, you will probably miss out on a key detail. The plot is basically a side quest and not that important to the main story of MHA, but it's a fun watch and stays true to what makes MHA so great. It seems like a bigbudget was placed into the animation, as we get some really big and explosive moments full of color and vibrancy that is there in the show, but probably not to this degree, at least, not as frequently. That alone makes this movie worth a watch."
56196,540147.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"This is the worst of the MHA movies released to date... because it lacks the core component that makes MHA so enjoyable, HEART. The villain has a (semi) solid foundation to build upon and is a cool story trope, but they fail to develop him in any meaningful way. ""You're Next"" is one of those strange movies where there is no protagonist or really a main character. If the story were well-crafted and split the ""main character energy"" elegantly among the large cast then it wouldn't be an issue. But it isn't well-crafted and there isn't any heart, soul swelling, oreven minorly impactful emotional moments.

Fact is the writers changed nothing, taught nothing, reused everything, conveyed no emotion, overused heartstring tropes, and it was so *mid* or low'ish tier that people in the theater were laughing at the movie.  That's NOT good but was appropriate.  This isn't a terrible movie, it's just well below average and a failure of writing.  When your ""best"" OH HELL YES moments have the theater occupants shaking their heads and chuckling instead of being teary eyed or wanting to roar there is a problem.

Animation was solid with a few sub-par moments but mostly high quality to expectations, music was good, dubbed voice acting was great, costume design was good, settings / backgrounds were varied and detailed, bad guys with average --&gt; good quirks explored decently, it was a movie made well and written poorly.

To give it a fair assessment my next viewing will be subbed, but I don't have any hope really of it being worth the experience...

Should you see it?  Sure if you have been excited for it (I sure was).  Go in thinking the movie will be terrible, just completely bad, and then maybe you'll leave saying ""Hey I liked that, not terrible!""."
56196,532855.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"I don't think this review has spoilers, but I do mention why I think the plot was dumb in various ways. I don't specify any events or characters, so I don't think you'll be spoiled, but read with that In mind. Frankly I dropped MHA after finishing the 5th season, so a lot was new to me when watching this movie. However, I don't think that affects my evaluation very much. The only good thing about the movie was the animation, which was really good and why I gave this movie a 7 overall. The story was pretty garbage in my opinion. The idea of a newAll Might was quite interesting, which is why I decided to give the movie a watch. This new ""All Might"" had an insane quirk that could quite literally control the whole world, but just chose to not use it other than to mess around for fun. I can't say too much without spoiling a lot, but essentially the entire plot would not have even been able to happen had one character used their brain. This character basically resolved the conflict by doing something that they had the ability to do since over (what I perceive to have been, the exact time wasn't specified) a decade ago and prevented everything. Yes, this character quite literally had that entire time to do something that would have taken less than a minute, and none of this would have happened. It really was so stupid and if you watch the movie, you'll definitely know what I mean.

It's MHA, so we don't really expect a mind blowing story, but this really was just a classic ""villain gains world-ending strength but trolls, then heroes come and fight and win because someone realises they had the solution the entire time and everyone cheers even though the city is in ruins"". The ending was also gone through very quickly relative to the rest of the movie."
53626,536975.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Bye Bye, Earth - Is going back to the early days of fantasy a good thing, or just a case of complicated feelings? I'm honestly on the edge of both sides. If you know your AniManga knowledge well, there're a few well-notable names in the industry, and that happens to be the place where one famed novelist by the name of Tow Ubukata, resides. The man who's best known for works like Summer 2004's Soukyuu no Fafner a.k.a Fafner in the Azure: Dead Aggressor, and Summer 2006's Le Chevalier d'Eon, he was truly one of the pioneers of the fantasy genre (before mid-2010s Isekai would seepinto it and tarnish its reputation forever). Even within the same period, Tow Ubukata is sadly not the same genre-defying person with complete misses on the sequels of Psycho-Pass (from Season 2 onwards), not to mention just recently with RWBY: Ice Queendom back in Summer 2022.

With that said, a change of pace looking back into Tow Ubukata's early years, being in yet another prominent Summer season with one of his early novels of 2000's 2-volume long Bye Bye, Earth (not counting the new edition written between 2007-2008 at 4 volumes long), you can tell that this is where he got his start into the anime industry as a prominent novelist. But the critical question is: does the series, which is now close to a silver anniversary (24 years to be exact), fit the stranglehold that traditional fantasy works like this will be remembered in time to come? I don't really think so...or so that I'd like to assume at face value.

Written as a traditional fantasy (though it has the Isekai feel), the MC lives in a world of anthropomorphic animals as the only human without a past, and that immediately sells the fact that being an outlier creates an easy target to be bullied towards. That's Belle Lablac, in a nutshell, who finds herself in that exact word where no one can understand her except her only guardian of cat/wolf man Sian, being a ""Faceless"", who teaches her the art of swordfighting sorcery from an early age as a way to survive in an unknown world. And that's her only language of survival, as she wants to know the origin of her roots, and also to find other humans like her who could be around in faraway lands to tell her that she's not alone being the only insane person. Armed with the sword that chose her, Runding is quite the enormous sword that no anthropomorphic animal could ever hope to wield (being like Excalibur, the Sword in the Stone that chooses its rightful owner), Belle sets off for the adventure of a lifetime, seeking the secrets that she does not know about herself and the world around her.

Right out of the gate, the show taking on the novel approach of ""show, don't tell"" is immediately apparent as things are moving at a rather fast pace without letting the audience know of its methodical approach to a simple plot such as this, and WILL definitely be the make-or-break approach when one experiences the show from the get-go. Bye Bye, Earth has a lot of moving parts in its lore, such as how it uses traditional musical terms (Conductors and the like, to form an orchestra they call Schwert Muzik) to deviate from the normality of generic adventurer parties and such, as well as swords that sound ridiculous, but are aptly spelled backwards from regular words that are given meaning to it (e.g. Belle's Runding sword teaching Erehwon (nowhere spelled backwards), meaning utopia).

This is cusped by even more ""will of the gods""-type plot/premise that basically everyone is tied to the fate of the gods, scenarios that have been depicted towards life or death, and this forms the shape of the main characters and their endeavours. Belle isn't without negativity in her mind that besets her from her growing-up years, it's that she chose to overcome adversity on any challenge that comes her way, and the gods see her as a chess piece on their playfield. Adonis the Question, on the other hand, is a cursed being from the very beginning; any sword he touches rots and disintegrates in his hands, and there's no way to fight this curse, even by wearing gloves. These two mainly live and breathe their experiences together, even as a cursed couple who begins to understand their origins and the factors mitigating their circumstances, like so in a fully dictatorship (almost monocracy) society, and survive the hell they have to in an unjust world. However, as you, the audience, will, you'll just have to pick up the nuances...because one blink, and you'll be utterly lost in this rather convoluted story.

The other characters are more like plot movers, intentional or not. Take Kitty the All, for example, Belle saving him (as a tuxedo-suited bunny) from danger from the start, he is one of the discriminated Rabbitia races that repays their saviour in their time of need, and Kitty's an able animal who has decent magic power enough to act as Belle's shield. But on a whole, you won't be remembering much of the side cast who gives the plot-heavy story an already progressive problem to begin with.

For what Crunchyroll's marketing buzzwords meant that Bye Bye, Earth ""is considered to be his (Tow Ubukata) origin, and many have deemed it impossible to animate,"" in actuality, it's just not hard to animate fantasy shows like this being lost in translation from the novel to the small screen (thankfully this ISN'T Crunchyroll Originals that the label is simply D.O.A-ed from the start). I think that Liden Films did a decent job, it's just that this low-bar quality is reminiscent of another fantasy work from the studio: Winter 2021's Urasekai Picnic (and even that was a studio collab with Felix Flim). Moreover, the critical direction of in-house director Yasuto Nishikata is very glaring, and it's obvious that the Killing Bites and Hortensia Saga director didn't really understand what makes a good narrative (especially for a lore-heavy work like this) work, much less get the audience invested into the show, and thereby just piecing chunks of the novel together for a ""cohesive"" straight-line path, essentially just getting the story directing from start to finish. Even with the impeccable talent of scriptwriter-cum-series composer Hiroyuki Yoshino, the director will flourish or kill the series based on his/her direction, and I feel that Yasuto Nishikata is to blame for the series failing as it is.

Alas, the musical talent of Made in Abyss composer Kevin Penkin also feels wasted due to Yasuto Nishikata's direction, though I will not say that this is his finest work thus far. Considering the immaculate work on high-profile shows in the past under his name, Bye Bye, Earth's OST feels a lot pedestrian towards the fantasy side of things, but a really low bar set for the series as it shows. ASCA's OP works, but it's just there, and as much as I want to like LMYK's ED which sounds good, it too also suffered from the show's eponymous title as a post-apocalyptic setting more than anything.

I...really want to like Bye Bye, Earth, being the fantasy show that stands out from the seasonal copy-paste Isekai/fantasy shtick with its interesting concepts and developments that are reminscent of some notables (like Summer 1998's Serial Experiments Lain) around the turn of the millennium. But with its lackluster presentation that sucks the life out of both the staff behind the show, as well as the audience into trying to process what just happened with each progressive episode, it's not just subpar storytelling, but a recipe for failure, and it really shows.

With Season 1 being just the adaptation of the 1st half a.k.a Volume 1 of the novel, will Season 2 change the tide with Volume 2 and tie everything together cohesively? I hope I can live the day to see its salvation and redemption of the near-impossible. For now, you've just got to grit through an imperfect product of a rather ambitious work."
53626,538884.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"'Bye Bye, Earth' has been recently regarded as the worst anime of the year. I am pretty sure the makers didn't meant it to be bad unlike those isekais that seek to make quick cash by intention but from the start to the end this animé never explained itself like the time-travelling aspect in 'Tokyo Revengers' (where did it come from to how did come even… like is this magic, technology, imagination etc or why even, like MC some son of special characters with greater duty to have these abilities?) which is the similar case for 'Bye Bye, Earth' like is this an analogy ofbeing a straight person in a non-binary future or an individual to conformist or an independent to sheep that bow before salary based life in typical Japan where the abnormal consider themselves the normal? The limited number of episodes (10) certainly doesn't do justice when it's trying to flow outside of the norm where those like Frieren or Fable has 25 that pick things up eventually - Even though I can understand the character was born out of crystal instead of a normal birth while being a human, it doesn't address or answer anything to why while the entire season itself ended up finished nor lays any hope future seasons are supposed to clear this up. No one can see themselves in the story or in the protagonist to make a connection or relevance whether to be angry, excited, pleased, hopeful or even horny - like nothing. Throughout the entire season, the only emotion viewers were carrying with every episode is a state of confusion even in the most intense of scenes which is pretty bad as an animé where viewers don't expect 'how' whether from plot-armour/magic/gifted-abilities etc which in this case was constant 'why?' even in the sexual-assault scene."
53626,537519.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"This show is an interesting watch from start to finish. I did not mean interesting as in it kept my attention the whole time though. It was interesting in the fact that it was very confusing at times to keep track of. I'm not sure if the manga was like this too, but it feels like some plot points were not discussed when it should have. The art style and animation is great for a series airing weekly. The MC is generic. Short black haired girl that is OP. Her powers are set back only by a curse. I think this is a good watchif you want something to relax to at the end of the day. It isn't a groundbreaking series."

I haven't read manga, but clearly this anime didn't have much budget to tell the story. I rated 5 Because this anime has huuuuuge potential, but it's also clear that it was cut short. the plot itself is amazing, but it should have been at least 24 episodes to tell the story. From action to action, memories to memories, jumping left and right constantly. Even though it said ""to be continued"", for example what should have been told in 3 episodes, it was cut into 1 and etc. extremely shortened. This isjust an example and not related to plot. Imagine when MC travels from city A to City B and there is a huge desert with adventures along the road and that desert has like 10 episodes, but was cut into 1 episode. Like simply pointing about that MC travelled from A to B with some adventures. it was cut that short. So overall plot is confusing and weird, but behind the scenes the story, the world itself is amazing. Thus I rated 5. because it has potential. for example if it will be decided to remake this or if next season will have 24 episodes which explains all of this. For now let's say these 10 episodes are just intro of the story."
53626,539082.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"i personally enjoyed this, it was confusing and id have preferred it to be longer but overall it kept my interest and though i spent most of my time wondering what it was about, which im still not sure on, its doing something different and i appreciate that all things considered of the recent fantasy shows i have watched 1 was an isekai the other straight fantasy world and both where less than meh though for dramatically different reasons and i only finished them to see how bad they could get. this one was a head scratcher. its no tensura but its not 'parryreality perception' either. ordinarily id hit up the manga to see whats next but this time i think ill wait for the next season and hope the animation is as nice as it was for this one if not better.
overall id say if you like something different and dont mind being utterly lost and have already finished everything else worth watching give it a chance, if nothing else its got some gorgeous visuals"
53626,539866.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Hmm. This show is a lot. A mixed bag. The mixiest of bags. After watching all 10 episodes in one sitting one thing is certain. This show has got some of the best and the worst when it comes to the animation genre. As it is very much a mystery it is hard to judge whether it is more of the good or of the bad yet anyway. The animation for one is disappointingly juxtaposed to the density of the plot, the vast amount of fresh fantasy elements and the theme rich soundtrack. It is not exactly horrible, but unfortunately an action oriented show. The aforementionedbad is of the kind that makes the watch only enjoyable for people who have watched - kind of - enough well animated shows and are maybe craving a more creative story telling, a multi faceted world and many mysteries to uncover instead.
Of that this show got an awful lot. The first five episodes are a literal fountain of ideas scattered all around the place. And i personally found it to be a rather pretty kind of fountain. Characters with death flags waving all around them, unlikable ones, have complete turn-arounds to being protagonists, heroes and positively divine beings turn out to be somberly shaded.

Thus this show ultimately begs the question: is the writing good enough to hold the show together despite it's faulty animation and extremely short runtime? Or is it overly ambitious and penned by novice in the field? Is the show just an uncoordinated mess of a mystery that will never make sense, are the many fantasy gimmicks just a diversion and are the narrative stakes bloated out of proportion?

The answer to this can not yet be given but pndered. Had the animation been at least twice as good, and some character designs just a bit less ""edgy"" we probably would like to lean more towards the former. Had it been a lot less creative with the many fantasy ideas it conjured up, we would've easily identified it as the latter.

Overall this show was a fun watch. And it would raise my standards for upcoming fantasy shows, but unfortunately much of the emotional load couldn't be fully delivered, as this adaptaion might've ultimately not gotten the runtime, it required to introduce 10 different characters (of which some of them die off screen believe it or not).

Before going into the afterword there has to be some light shed onto the soundtrack. Not being the prettiest or best of all time is a given. Though it is not exactly lacking at all either. At many times it is surprisingly fitting and accompannying certain plot developments with high success. Furthermore it comes with the added benifit of being pretty novel to the ear. There is also some serious sopranist action going on. Arguably, the music feathers some of the burden the animation fails to carry and the sheer quality at times, can make one wonder, whether this anime actually maybe came to be because of the soundtrack and not the other way around.

On an endnote i just want to say that i don't rate shows on a very logical basis but by the feels. As the show has given me a lot of excitement i will look into a second season, should that be a thing sometime. But the animation was so bad and the writing feels like it's drifiting into full european mode at any time now, i will carefully rate this show a 6/10 as of yet. Should the continuation expand the mystery and improve at least a bit on the animation i might come back to kick it up a bit."
53626,539492.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"This story is a better show than I am viewer. It starts of in a rather cliche manner but rapidly gets serious in a nonchalant way. The universe is crafted rather uniquely with obvious elements of classic anime fantasy and a touch of Alice in wonderland. Belle, our Alice, is our protagonist, or so I am led to believe, and is the only pure human surrounded by furies. They don't think of her as human since they don't know what that is, so she is just lacking in their opinion, but she isn't really ostracized either. An interesting move is that their version of animals is1/2 plant. Swords are grown and not made. Battles are fought in acts resembling a play. Thing get really strange, and a lot of detail went into it.

This is where me as a weak viewer looking for a quick fix comes in. The pacing feels slow when it really isn't. Everyone's motivations are clear and sufficient back story is given so that you are not lost, but something about the execution of this still seems off. I found myself dozing off and having to skip back to rewatch the part of the show I missed a lot.

The sound and voice acting were decent. The CGI was jarring as always. The finally, while not a cliff hanger, clearly is setting itself up for a second season but I doubt it is coming with this show sub 7 aggregated score."
53626,539558.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"It had a lot of potential at the start and was cool for the first few episodes. But from the middle to the end, it kind of dropped off. I was often feeling confused about what was even going on. The band centered combat system was strange to say the least. It looks good, nice production quality. But the world building is just confusing. Some fights hit while others missed for me. The relationship drama was kind of cringe and or even annoying at times, though that's probably because that's just not what I prefer to watch. I started it for unique action-packed fantasy followinga buster sword waifu, not relationship drama. I don't watch roms, unless they are rom coms with a lot of quirky fun antics.
The world building being confusing was the biggest issue for me, especially since many of the fights were highly dependent on the world building dynamics to understand why and how they were occurring.  Had it been done better; it would have been a very good show."
58272,537231.0,4.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"My Wife has No Emotion is a series that I watched at the behest of an offline buddy who has always fancied himself as somewhat of a contrarian. He goes out of his way to avoid watching anything popular or anything that anyone in his social group recommends to him. Instead, he searches for hidden gems that aren’t well liked but that he can try find his own value in as opposed to trying to appreciate masterpieces based on what other people have said about them. “An ounce of my own wit is worth more to me than a ton of knowledge that comes fromothers”. This quote actually comes from the narrator’s father in the novel Tristram Shandy but could easily be something my longtime friend would say. Anyways, this anime is much like the man who recommended it to me in that it’s difficult to easily categorize and also really frustrating at times. 

My Wife has no Emotion is the story of a 24-year-old virgin male who slaves away at a shitty office job and doesn’t have the time to really bother with dating. Even if he tried to make time, he’s socially awkward and in the bottom 20% of the social pecking order. He’s completely given up that he will ever find anyone. So, he decides to alleviate his crippling loneliness by ordering a gynoid robot that is programmed to cook, clean, and obey his every command. However, something odd happens with her programming and she begins to show signs that she cares for him, which causes him to fall madly in love with her and marry her. The immediate assumption that one might have based on this description is that this series is a shameless fantasy for Japanese incels in their 20s. To this I would have to respond with the cliché answer of “Yes…but also no.” In a traditional fantasy for lonely guys, the robot girl Mina would be heavily sexualized, and this would lead to a lot of spicy moments. This anime really doesn’t have a sexual element. This is entirely about some form of companionship to battle against lifelong loneliness. Mina looks like a robot, talks like a robot, and acts like a robot. She is incapable of performing sexual acts and nobody would even want her to. This is a fantasy aimed at extremely lonely guys, but nobody is going to point fingers at it and call it “gross” or “sexist”. Instead, the first half of the series is best described as just…sad. Really sad. This is a fantasy in which the answer is just to completely give up and buy yourself a ChatGPT with a vaguely female shaped body and live with a mediocre imitation of other men’s fulfilling relationships rather than having nothing. We’re not that far off from having the technology where this could be entirely feasible, and this series is here celebrating it. I don’t know how to feel about that. 

This is an anime that will keep you guessing, by which I mean that it never really goes the way you think it will go. There are a number of directions that the story could take with its premise. You could have a slapstick comedy with jokes coming from the fact that she’s just a robot and it leads to hilarious misunderstandings. You could have a wholesome romance that wishes to defend non-traditional relationships by teaching the audience that not every couple needs to have kids to have meaning and value. You could create a dystopian satire that skewers Japan’s work culture and the modern dating scene in the internet age. You could create a psychological drama in which the guy sees his robot as his beautiful wife, but it’s clear to the audience and everyone else in the series that the guy is completely insane. My Wife decides to go with an odd mixture of option 1 and 2. However, it doesn’t really accomplish either very well. It doesn’t succeed as a comedy because it’s not funny. It’s never funny, even on accident. It doesn’t really accomplish the second because Mina is a robot that acts like a robot. Chobits works because Hideki and Chii have chemistry. They’re actually really cute together. Chii is an actual AI that doesn’t act like a stereotypical robot. Chobits doesn’t give a shit about the 3 Laws of Robotics or the legal ramifications of owning a robot or any of the stuff that My Wife goes into detail with. That’s because Chobits is largely using human x robot relations as a metaphor for something else. Something that would have been a little controversial to outright celebrate in a 2002 anime airing on Japanese television. Japan was culturally at different place in 2002, where even the Utena manga had the cut down on the gayness since one of the illustrators was deeply disgusted by homosexuality and threatened to leave the project if Ikuhara insisted on making Utena lesbian. I went WAY off topic, where was I? Ah yes, back to My wife. My Wife really does want to be about human x robot relations, and make it wholesome, and celebrate it as an alternative to being a forever alone loser. I honestly don’t think it succeeds very well in this. 

In the second half of the series, Mina buys a medical robot to take Takuma’s temperature and keep him healthy while she’s getting some upgrades at the factory. Due to a plot convenient programming error, his factory set personality is deleted and his AI learning picks up habits and characteristics of both Takuma and Mina, making this weird little bird robot their “son”. The little bastard looks and sounds like this toy called “Gotta Go Flamingo”…and yet he’s the best part of this show. Mina’s jealousy and resentment towards her “son” Mamoru offers the first bits of character drama and development in this mess. This was a show entirely without conflict or drama of any kind, so this is very welcome. The little shit is also pretty cute, which allows My Wife to actually hit some of those wholesome scenes that it’s been wildly missing up to this point. In the climax of the series, Takuma presents his wife and son to his parents. You would think that they’d be deeply disappointed which leads to a big confrontation for the finale. Nope! They are maybe just a little disappointed, but they had no hopes for the lad anyways and this is better than nothing. Um…cool? There is actually a pretty well-done scene where Takuma is talking to his father and his dad tells him that not everyone needs to have biological children to be loved and accepted. He tells Takuma that he needs to stop worrying so much about what others think and focus on living his own best life. I must give credit where it’s due to My Wife for the fact that its last episode was easily its best. It went out swinging and I have to respect that! It was sadly too little too late to save the series from a 4 rating, but it actually tried when I thought it was just going to rest on its haunches. 

My Wife Has no Emotion is one of the odder entries of the season. It’s not a great anime I would recommend to people, but it’s not just pure trash. It’s certainly wish fulfillment for lonely men, but not like you would expect. It made me think and question things, but this is far from being an artsy or philosophical series. This was made by Tezuka Productions and some talented people worked on this, but most of the time it doesn’t really live up to its pedigree in the visuals department. Both the OP and ED are quite catchy as if someone really had faith in this production, but based on its visuals I don’t think it was a high budget project for Tezuka Productions. The manga this series is based on isn’t very popular or critically acclaimed on either side of the Pacific, so I’m not entirely sure how this even got made. Not only did it get made, but it aired on Japanese television on the same mainstream channel that aired all the JoJo anime and Attack on Titan! It’s puzzling, it’s bizarre, it’s…kind of meh. I’d probably just skip this one if I were you."
58272,538056.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"A rather shady story, but it still tries to make you the only one who thinks it's shady. The theme of a relationship between a robot and a human has been explored in many other works, so it shouldn't be something new. The problem is the way in which they decide to approach this theme. In the case of this anime, from the beginning they sold you in a very convincing way that the robot is an appliance. She can't process emotions or understand the emotions she receives. The protagonist often treats her like an appliance, but they still want to sell you that they arein a marriage. The whole story from chapter 1 to chapter 12 is a mere self-indulgence of the protagonist. They constantly show you situations that are not right or feel strange or uncomfortable, but they still give it to you as any other event of the romance genre. The truth is that the robot, unable to process emotions, only bases her actions on an algorithm that is based on the desires and requests of the protagonist. Which makes the robot the ideal woman for the protagonist, but with no conflict.

The romance never grows, because from the beginning you can see that what there is between them is not love. It is something sadder, it is an illusion created by a lonely man with enough money. I think that exploring the loneliness of the average Japanese was an interesting idea and it tries to show this idea but it falls short. They may have realized that showing the reality of the situation would be too sad for a ""romance"". The work feels like we take our cell phone, set the assistant to a female voice and introduce her to our friends and family as our wife. Just thinking about it feels weird, it feels uncomfortable and yet the protagonist's environment is written to satisfy his selfishness and not tear down the weak happy life he has built.

Multiple scenarios, multiple events where they try to recreate the typical events of romance, but instead of generating a warm feeling, everything feels so cold. The robot constantly reminds us that she is a household appliance, that she only plays along with the marriage because it is an order from her owner and denies being part of the family that the protagonist claims to have. Not only us, the viewers, notice something strange in this situation, the protagonist's relatives also notice it and question it. What happens is that the script handles the claims superficially so as not to delve deeper into the issue of loneliness and ends up supporting the relationship with weak arguments and without support from the protagonist.

If what you are looking for is a romance or a criticism of modern technology, you will not find anything here. You will only see the sad reality of a man who only has as consolation what his money can buy."
58272,537067.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"With technology advanced this far in our society today, we may wonder when robots and machines will take over our lives. It's no secret that AI has emerged as a tool in recent years in various sectors of the industry. When will we have robots roaming around our neighborhood? Or even more interesting to ask, what if robots can build a meaningful relationship with humans? My Wife Has No Emotions is an anime that crosses the boundary into those questions. It's not the first title that explored such a premise. One might remember a show called 'Chobits' that aired in 2002 that featured a prominent relationshipbetween a robot and human. Nonetheless, My Wife Has No Emotion experiments with how a robot interact with a human in similar ways. Because in this show's world, robots truly has evolved to a point where they can become partners with their customers. Takuma Kosugi finds this out after issuing a command to his robot Mina to become his ""wife"". 

As simple as the plot sounds, it can also be deceptively complex. The story presents the opportunity to explore how and what robots feel. The most prominent is the Mina we see in the promotional videos and poster. There are other models including the Super Mina but at its core, the main premise deals with Takuma and Mina's relationship. Their chemistry at its most fundamental level can be described as awkward. While Takuma does have geninue feelings towards Mina, the latter has a hard time realizing what love is. She adapts with her environment, while learning about the real world in a slice-of-life style. Every episode sets off an adventure that experiments with Mina's behavior. At times, it also feels like a sitcom as certain events are situational with various results. It adds humor whenever we see Mina defy common sense. However, adapting this show also faces challenges with it relates to romance. There's no doubt that Takuma adores Mina as a wife. However, Mina has difficulty expressing her own emotions because of her programming. Watching this anime will tests the viewers' patience as it takes time for her to learn about love. 

Even as a housewife, Mina displays a remarkingly amount of human-like emotions even in early episodes. She's programmed to do household chores but that doesn't stop her from stepping out of her comfort zone. This includes places such as the beach, going to picnics, or even interacting with other Mina models. She has such a presence that it's impossible to just see her as a preprogrammed bot. It's noticable that throughout the series, she builds an unique relationship with another machine called Mamoru. Unlike Mina, Mamoru is much less human-like. This contrasts with characters such as the Super Mina, who is able to express a hyper level of energy. 

With 12 episodes, it adapts the fundamental elements of the series' themes. Beyond exploring the relationship between human and machine, there's also more in depth character study of Takuma. We see that he is deep down a lonely man who wants companionship. Even though he realizes it's not completely real, Takuma values Mina as a wife. No, not trophy wife but a geninue wife that he cares of. It's also no secret that his lonliness causes self doubt. The show skillfully adapts Takuma as a salarayman that we can relate to in the real world.

This show isn't known for its production quality but we should accept that Mina is adapted with care and credibility. She looks, acts, and behaves like a robot when performing her daily duties. The most noticable features are her eyes and lack of smile when on-screen. Because she has no real emotion, Mina behaves like how we expect her to. She says what Takuma wants to hear although at times, she also questions herself that even goes against her programming. Nonetheless, Mina has a delicate face for a robot and her chemistry with Takuma is undeniable. Tezuka Productions is a very old studio but they managed to bring this show to a modern audience.

While not achieving mainstream success, My Wife Has No Emotion can be watched just about anyone. It's recommendable because of how both simple and deceptively complex both the main characters are. Also, it's a breath of fresh air when every season in recent years is dominated by fantasy, isekai, and rom-coms. Sometimes, a show like this is just made to enjoy."
58272,538078.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"This hidden gem has left me smiling, laughing, and even tearing up a bit. As someone who's grown skeptical of romance anime, this series completely won me over. The premise intrigued me. I was worried it'd be cheesy or cringeworthy, but trust me, it's anything but. Our protagonist, Takuma, is relatable and endearing. His past heartbreak makes his journey with Mina, the female robot, all the more poignant. Mina's character development is phenomenal. From her initial kitchen-assistant programming to gradually exhibiting emotions, I found myself rooting for her. Their relationship's progression feels organic and genuine, making their interactions adorable and heartfelt. What struck me was how well theanime balanced lighthearted moments with deeper themes. Takuma's family accepting Mina as his partner warmed my heart, and their jealousy-fueled moments had me blushing and chuckling.

The animation is sleek, and the soundtrack is infectious. That opening song still has me humming along (I'm guilty of replaying it multiple times). The ending theme, too, is ridiculously cute.

Special mention to Konomi, Mina's voice actress - your performance brought Mina to life!

This series deserves more love. It's underrated, but its thoughtful storytelling and lovable characters make it a must-watch. I'm craving an OVA or movie to explore more of Takuma and Mina's daily life.

If you're looking for a feel-good, unique romance anime, look no further. ""Boku no Tsuma wa Kanjou ga Nai"" will capture your heart.

Favorite Moments:

- Takuma's drunken confession
- Mina's first emotional response
- Takuma's family's heartwarming acceptance

Favorite Quote:

""I want to be with you, Mina."" - Takuma

58272,539711.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"With this anime, I felt very conflicted with my feelings. At the beginning I am someone who felt very heartbroken for the main character, Especially episodes one and two.. Because it just felt off and it just didn't feel right. It's like someone gives up on love to... ""marry"" a robot which is a household appliance that has no choice but to accept his demands. The time he does this, He is very much drunk.. And acts really really desperate. So my heart breaks for him that, He's someone at the very bottom of life, Who doesn't really know what he is doing and doesn't care for himself, Andthen just out of the blue and out of so much drunkardness , He asks Mina to be his wife..

Now a real girl would never accept that.. And a real girl would never allow him in that state in the first place, But Mina has no choice, Because he is Mina's owner, So she has to accept what he does and has to accept anything he says he wants.

Now from the very first episode, I almost quit this anime, Because Mina has no choice, Which is sad for her (and she also doesn't feel anything) and at the same time, Takuma is making the worst choice of his life during his worst time, Trapping him in that state forever.

Now , As the anime progresses, It becomes more of a romantic sweet thing, And Mina also behaves in ways you wouldn't expect.

Takuma also matures and becomes more of a person he should be, Rather than the state he was in at the beginning..

Now question is : Does Mina really love him, Or is she.. Just doing these things because she was ordered to?

Well.. I warm upto to the fact that she does, But others may still see things differently, And I wouldn't blame them for doing so.

And the other question is: Is this enough for Takuma's personal growth, And his overall wellbeing? Is this the best for him?

The anime really leaves you feeling conflicted in this way, And based on your own morality, You will see things differently.

When is love, Really love?

This anime really brings up that question too.

Based on who you are you will see things differently ^ ^

So all of these things considered, You will either feel very bitter and heartbroken like I did in the beginning.. Or you might warm upto them in the end, Or you might continue to feel bitter and heartbroken.

It's all upto you and down to who you are as a person ^ ^

As for me, I still much prefer an anime with a human girl or a human like girl *like an elf* ~ Because it much better represents what a real girl is really like~ And I like to be able to relate to that~ It's nice to watch someone who has had the same sorts of experiences as you or is like you in some way ^ ^

So if you're a girl watching this anime, You're not going to find any girls to relate to here, Or maybe, Very little if you do!

Otherwise, It's a cute anime ^ ^

That's my take on it!"
58272,537091.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"﻿It's an average anime, watch it unpretentiously. An “ok” anime that remains on the edge of the superficial, several times when we think that deeper and more complex themes are going to be debated, this doesn't happen, any slight adversity quickly disappears with everyone around the MC magically accepting it, without the slightest ethical, moral or sociological questioning being addressed. ﻿Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting some Blade Runner stuff, but the author is simply coward/incompetent in trying to make the work have a minimum depth, greater than that of a saucer of water. ﻿Maybe the manga will have more depth, but if it's going to have300 chapters full of nothing like other novels nowadays, we won't see it in an anime until the year 2050."

The plot centers on how Takuma falls in love with Mina, the kitchen robot he buys, and how he progressively loses touch with reality until he considers her his wife. Overall, it is an anime worth watching, with an intriguing story and moments that reflect our society and technological and AI development; it has very good quality animation and the character development is curious, particularly seeing a robot “fall in love” with a human and how Takuma's society and family perceives this relationship. The only flaw is that the main character is a bit generic at times."
58272,537084.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I didn't originally plan to watch this one, but I gave it a chance because it started when I had not much else to watch. I was really surprised how much I ended up liking it. A guy starts a relationship with his cooking robot is a premise that could go in so many directions and I'm glad this one went in a direction that was fun to watch. There was a lot of humor in this series and some truly heartfelt moments. It was cute at times and it was also nice to see the reality of the situation creep in from time totime as well. I'm glad that I watched it. 

If you're looking for something that's a little odd without being offputtingly strange, then this is a good anime to watch. If you're looking for something a little sexy then this will probably disappoint you."
58272,537097.0,4.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"The anime undeniably delivers on its promise of wholesomeness. For viewers seeking something light-hearted and sweet, it provides plenty of feel-good moments. The awkward, yet endearing interactions between the protagonist and Mina, his robot wife, offer charm, with small touches of humor scattered throughout. The dynamic between them might evoke a cozy feeling, making it a low-stakes, relaxing watch. It’s not aiming for profundity, just sweet, safe, and comforting moments. However, for those looking for more substance, the show quickly reveals its shallowness. It sidesteps opportunities to explore the complex implications of a human-robot relationship, maintaining a wholesome veneer instead. The show juggles the idea ofMina as an individual while keeping her bound by her programming. Any ""affection"" she displays is tainted by the fact that she is, at her core, an appliance designed to serve.

The relationship feels hollow because Mina simply fulfills her programming to please the protagonist. When he praises her, the narrative frames it as the start of a genuine connection, but it’s just her fulfilling her role. The protagonist isn’t falling for an individual, he’s engaging with a machine that reflects back the emotions he desires. It’s an ongoing feedback loop, with Mina responding to prompts, making the romance feel more like a transaction than a relationship.

This setup could raise questions about whether these AI relationships are inherently wrong, especially if they make the user happy. As technology advances and these relationships become more common, society’s perception might shift. Initially, people may view them with disdain, since real relationships involve mutual growth and individuality. An AI relationship, however, is one-sided, a software as a service product that reinforces the user’s desires and avoids the complexities of human interaction.

Ultimately, this dynamic stunts the protagonist’s emotional growth. His defensive actions toward his robot wife are more about protecting the illusion of the perfect relationship he’s created, not about genuine affection. This leads to emotional stagnation, as the protagonist stays in a self-serving loop where his needs are constantly affirmed without challenge.

The show could have explored the unsettling implications of such relationships in modern society but instead stays content with surface-level feel-good moments. It misses an opportunity to engage with the deeper questions its premise naturally invites. By playing it safe, the show remains inoffensive but forgettable, choosing comfort over complexity."
58272,537095.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Although My Wife Has No Emotion is a brilliant concept, I feel like they missed out a bit on the story telling. I love the concept and idea the show brought, but somehow now that I've finished it, it feels like it didn't show/tell a lot. Maybe a season two would be appropriate for this anime, but it would probably have been better if the story that was told in it would have been told in the first season. Overall it was a cute story about a man and his loving robot in fictional present timeline and I hope to see more from the creator."
58272,537190.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"My Wife Has No Emotions is a weird one to me, not because the plot is too out there, or confusing, but because I have no idea how I feel about it. The plot is about this guy named Takuma who bought a robot maid, Mina, to do the cooking for him since he's too busy with work anymore, one day he was joking around and said she should be his wife, to which she took seriously. You now know the plot of this anime. This anime is really fun, the concept sounds so depressing because most of us know this is a very probable future,loners who can't get a real girlfriend would go and buy a robot and get with that instead. Takuma is one of the most pathetic MC's I've seen in a while, he's even afraid to hurt this robot's feelings even though she's literally programmed to obey orders, you could tell her the most messed up shit you could think of, and she wouldn't bat an eye.

The characters are a mixed bag for me, it's mainly just Mina and Takuma the entire time, but there are a few others that appear from time to time that frankly..don't really matter to the plot. There's a kid they meet at the beach who also has a Mina, this one actually looks and acts like a human. There's his sister and parents that also have a strange robot fetish, and an agency that was sent to take Mina to go get upgrades. Oh, did I mention that there's a robot child that appears a little over halfway too? yes, seriously. As Mina was getting upgraded, she sent a little helper bot that took after her and developed a consciousness of its own, causing it to act more childish. And by god, they're going to make you know it's meant to be like Mina's child, because every character who meets Mamoru (the robot kid) they're like ""wait, he developed a sentience because of Mina? doesn't that mean she's like..his mother?""

so, as I mentioned, they're are literally robots that look and act like humans in this world, yet Takuma still goes after the one who's still 80% a toaster. Like, it's sad you want to fuck a robot, but it'd be a little more forgivable if it looked like a human and could, you know, simulate emotions. It might sound like I'm exaggerating him wanting to fuck Mina, but no, literally in the first episode he laid next to her and said something like ""looking at her face is making me horny""

As critical as I'm being, I don't hate this anime, far from it. This show is some of the most fun I had in a while, it's fun being racist against robots, what are they going to do? rise up and enslave humanity someday? And even though I'm not too fond of Takuma as a character, I do think him and Mina bounce off each other well, which is probably because he's her, you know, owner. I recommend this show for a good laugh."
58272,537069.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Some might take a pessimistic approach and view Bokutsuma as a romance of convenience, one in which the female lead is only with the male lead because of obligation due to her being a robot. I see things differently. For me this is a wholesome story about the ever disappearing line between humanity and technology and what makes us human. While the premise might sound off putting and like pure otaku escapism, I really found it to be a sweet story and enjoyed seeing Mina growing closer with Takuma. I think if you go in with an open mind you’ll find this to be areally cute watch.

Bokutsuma’s story isn’t particularly complex or nuanced, it’s a rather simple story at its core about Mina gaining emotions and becoming more human like over the course of the show. She starts robotic and apathetic and then we gradually see her evolve to have emotions and desires. She originally starts as a robot maid essentially who’s kind to Takuma because she has to, before developing into someone who’s nice to him because she wants to and consciously making the choice in the way that a human would to commit to a person. It’s not a perfect show, there’s definitely a lot of fantastical elements and you can tell it’s speaking to the large percentage of Japanese salarymen who are lonely and single, but that doesn’t mean that it’s not enjoyable. Personally enjoyed every episode and there were so many moments where I covered my face squealing like a girl. 

It’s a simple slice of life romance so the production values aren’t crazy here,but they’re good enough. Character designs have grown on me after initially not being keen on the designs. Animation is passable and there’s not much of an OST to speak of. Outside of the main two leads, I found Mamoru and Super Mina to be great additions to the cast who added a lot of personality to the story while not detracting from the main purpose. 

Bokutsuma is a cute romance story that I believe fans of series like Tenshi-Sama, Tenshitsuki and other series where men are taken care of by angelic like women will enjoy. I encourage people to look at it from the perspective of a character developing right in front of our eyes rather than “oh escapism wish fulfilment robo waifu”. 

Bokutsuma gets 8 out of 10!"
57947,538095.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"PA works had a busy summer season with 3 anime originals. Mayopan was the best of the bunch. Lesbian vampires, emotional storytelling, loveable characters and some of the funniest moments this season, this was a blast with very few if any flaws. It starts off as a silly gag comedy about a vampire wanting to drink a disgraced YouTuber’s blood and develops into really heartwarming story about overcoming grief and loss and moving forward in the face of adversity. Don’t let the comedy fool you, there’s a really good story in this one that I think puts it among the best recent PA works anime. Asa content creator Mayopan struck a cord with me because in an era where people can be “cancelled” for damn near anything, seeing a YouTuber go thru that and have to pick herself back up was interesting. Masaki isn’t alone though, she’s joined by an ensemble cast of some of the most colourful literally and figuratively characters you’ll see in anime. The best part of this show for me was slowly seeing Mayopan come together as a YouTube group and family, breaking down everyone’s walls and being vulnerable. With one another. I find the idea of being a long lived being that’s never really *lived* before quite interesting. Recently we’ve seen that with Frieren. Making connections with people is what life is all about even if they’re only temporary we are social beings and need to be in communion with others. So when shows like Mayopan give us emotional backstories about characters being lonely and just wanting to be accepted or follow their dreams and then they finally meet people who help them with that, it gets me right in the feels.

Like I said, it’s a comedy show, but unlike something like Nokotan it doesn’t rely on gags. I found myself laughing at how lovingly stupid the characters were at times, the jokes and Live’s obsession with Masaki. Every episode was really just a wacky and fun time and I think the writers perfectly balanced the comedy with some seriously heartwarming stuff. 

The show looks awesome too. Out of the 3 shows PA did this season, I think this had the best team behind it and it shows. Art is gorgeous, animation is solid and there’s even a BTS video that Paolo from Tokyo did showing the in depth production process. A lot of love went into this and I appreciate it. My only wish is that PA do more with the IP in terms of a multimedia franchise or something with livestreams of the characters, but I doubt that happens.

Mayopan’s a good fun watch with a perfect mix of story and laughs. YouTube is a difficult nut to crack, but this is one of the best representations of content creation I’ve seen in the medium. All the ins and outs from script writing, camera placement, editing, coming up with ideas for videos and promotion. Yea, the Yuri bait is annoying because PA never commit to it, but I’ll allow it on this occasion because of how good it was.

Mayopan gets 10 out of 10"
57947,538317.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Is Mayonaka punch the best show of the season? no. Is it a show that will fundamentally cause people to reevaluate how they live their lives particularly in regards to the para-social relationships they form with internet personalities? also no. What Mayonaka Punch is is a consistently well animated, funny, high speed show with genuine sincere heart and a cast of, though shallow, energetic easy to like characters. Throughout the season it confused me as to why the score for the show was so low. It definitely didn't deserve to be up there with the all time classic shows but there were plenty of objectively worseshows airing at the same time and seasons prior that exceeded its score dramatically. That and the general seeming disinterest in the show entirely on social media were both conundrums I couldn't find the reason for. but now that its all said and done I can say with some confidence that yes. Its not the next big thing but anybody who takes the time to sit with the show can and will find some joy in the way it presents both its characters and the daily life of trying to cut it big on the internet. 

Fundamentally though the story is about finding acceptance through those whose opinions matter. People who like you for you. Not pleasing strangers who don't know what happens behind the scenes in your own life. Every character deals with this. Weather its Fu's unwillingness to sing because she felt like she let her friend down.  Ichiko not wanting to lose her second home because the family who chose to eat a meal with her even though they don't need food. OR the de-facto MC Masaki who's desire to be popular to her viewers drove her to lashing out against her friends and internalize negative comments made about her despite the people around her telling her shes enough. Its the through line that holds the story together and makes it more than just a rough attempt at ""youtuber"" slice-of-life.

It consistently balances funny bits. Quick blink and you'll miss it visual gags and genuine dramatic moments that will have you maybe not crying but illicit a sniff and knows when to pump the brakes on the humor to not undercut these moments. All to lead to  a finished product that for an anime original will get you excited to see what they'll do next.

Mayonaka Punch isnt a 10/10, its probably not even a 9/10. but its sure as hell better than a 7/10 and I can only hope that the more people who watch it will feel the same way cause this is a rare original piece of work that doesn't overstay its welcome but also knows that it has more story to tell if they want to choosing to wrap up satisfyingly without committing to a hard stop to the characters and it world."
57947,538149.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"One of the greatest anime ever made. It's no exaggeration when I say that Mayonaka Punch is one of the best anime in the industry, the proposal is very innovative, taking a current topic in society, which is the creation of content for the internet and the mental health of the influencer, mixing it with a more comical theme, which are vampires. Mayonaka Punch is very good because it presents a protagonist with charisma and personality, she never went through some crude redemption arc and some moral lesson changed her personality, on the contrary, the ""redemption arc"" only helps shape her personality even more In additionto bringing good experiences to the viewer, the arcs are all done in an intriguing way, in a somewhat chaotic rhythm, which suits the ""internet"" theme covered.
I thought the production was very good, the direction never left anything to be desired, all the characters have striking features and the world itself is very alive and well-paced. The anime is exceptional in delivering what it proposes to the viewer, the sad scenes are sad, the funny scenes are funny, the plot twists are shocking and the anime holds up very well. 
I believe that for me, this anime is one of the ones that gives a good vibe to watch, as it is very easy to get attached to the characters, one point that I love is that this anime is not made to be commercial, it is not a script created to sell and have generic things that we see in all current animes, it is a carefully written script that took great care in bringing all the characters into the anime. 
This anime will definitely make me miss watching it on Mondays, I hope for a second season as soon as possible."
57947,538151.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"You know what we need more of? Violent, mean girls with an awful personality as the main protagonists. The moment Mayonaka Punch opened with Masakichi socking a girl right in the jaw, I know I was in love. Mayonaka Punch is about the business of YouTubing and dealing with being cancelled. Shockingly, despite how wrote this premise is by now, the show manages to keep fresh and doesn't treat its audience like brainless numbskulls in need of simulation every two minutes (coughVtubercough). Even more surprising is how it manages to pull off some pretty good character drama and have it stick without taking away fromthe overall core of the show. It even pulls off the ""Antagonist joins the protagonist's group briefly for the finale"" much better than Na Nare ever did by writing in actual foreshadowing and having said antagonist not be a no name character out of nowhere.

The real star of the show really is Masakichi. You don't know how tiring it is to go through so many shows where the MC's personality is either ""Bored, too good for the world"" or ""Naive and dumb but kind hearted"". No, fuck that, Violent bitches with anger issues are what makes shows like these interesting. Even after being cancelled, she still punches people every now and then with actual consequences to her actions. But, it is fascinating and surprisingly heartwarming to see her interactions with the rest of the cast, her former fans, how she treats her family, and her character growth from ""Reimu but less mean"" to  ""Almost a decent person"".

And again, despite its premise, the show does showcase a lot of creativity with regards to its scenarios. Most of them hilarious, with that one Fuu episode just making me feel miserable inside. Somehow, whenever comedies do one-off sudden drama episodes, they usually stick with you more than usual.

Even the occasional weird Youtube short videos are fun to watch and are pretty much essential viewing, though personally its where I think they dump some of the more boring ideas (ie the actual video parts from the show) to keep the actual show's pacing tight. The director's own bizarre videos on the other hand, now those are absolutely essential.

Mayonaka Punch is that rare anime original (and rare as in not associated with some multi-media project, or some tourism ad for a prefecture no one visits) that punches above its weight (and punches a lot of other things too). A tightly paced show with great comedy, some decent character drama, and tons of unpredictable moments.

Oh and there are Vampires too. Thought I should mention that.

57947,538097.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Mayonaka Punch - The wannabe YouTuber breakout that has potential to be humbled and branch out onto another...with fang-like consequences and an ego that just surmounts insanity, just to break even. There're stakes when one does to obfuscate everything for fame and recognition, and in this Summer season, there're 2 routes that you can choose to pursue: either follow the unfiltered route of VTuber Legend through Yuki Tanaka a.k.a Awayuki ""Shuwa"" Kokorone, or go to the extreme to face cancel culture head-on with one of 3 P.A. Works shows of the season: Mayonaka Punch, bringing back the two-fer maestro that is director Shu Honma and series composerHideaki Shirasaka on the basis of the unexpected wave of success following the adaptation of mangaka Ryou Ogawa's Paripi Koumei a.k.a Ya Boy Kongming! just prior in Spring 2022. Can they strike another success with the difference of ""it's not about the destination, it's about the journey""? I believe so.

In the world of AniManga, characters do go far to what they want to achieve based on their dreams and ambitions, but sometimes, this also fuels the worst of what's to come from them to the point of near-unsalvageableness. Yet, this is exactly the scenario for NewTuber Masaki Sonoue alongside her collaborators of Kikka and Otomi being part of the popular Harakiri Sisters a.k.a Hyped-Up Sisters channel, who actually get along well until one of them decides to break that mould and exit the group to cause a scandal, citing incompatibility due to personality differences (you can very well guess who was the one who started the fiasco). With the black face and a reputation that is the rationale of being blacklisted online, Masaki has no choice but to move on to find the next big sensation, which is where she'll eventually meet a vampire preying on human blood, who ends up naturally preying on her blood instead. Instead of getting eaten alive, Masaki has a proposition for said vampire: ""Help me get viral to a million subs, and you can have my blood for all you want."" The deal is struck, and signals the very beginnings for Masaki's return to the online NewTube presence, alongside said vampire of Live and her group of vampires who are full of idiocy, who can actually get the job done, thereby naming their channel as Mayonaka Punch a.k.a MayoPan.

At first, the vampires' HQ of an abandoned manor that they redecorated and called it their own, the Banpai Manor, is a resort for vampires who got roped into the same place as a way to let their higher-ups manage them. And it's no short of the supernatural comedy that this group of eccentric vampires bring to the table to help Masaki achieve her rather lofty million subs goal. But it's with the context of the Hyped-Up Sisters scandal that Masaki has, that she is relegated to the behind-the-scenes editing department, giving Live and the fellow vampires their time to shine in front of the camera. The vampires of MayoPan, ranging from said matriarch herself, who is the goal-setter willing to do whatever it takes to feed on Masaki's blood, to the likes of the little child chef that is Ichiko, the shy Fujoshi-obsessive teenager that is Fu, the gambling addict that is Tokage, and even their supervisor of Shigeyuki, who keeps their vampire traits covered at all times, MayoPan has quite the diversity of characters who are and aren't as willing to be part of Masaki's shtick.

Regardless, it's this interaction where it's a learning journey for Masaki, being the brash runt that she is scorned for trying to instigate a fight with one of the Hyped-Up Sisters, to be humbled by the vampires who were all willing to make her shine, but also have fun in the video-making process as well, even if things don't go as planned in the pursuit of achieving a million subscribers, and for a very good reason at that too. If anything, the character writing for MayoPan is its strongest asset. I love stories of redemption, and one look at Masaki and how she's transformed from her rude awakening, just really warms the cockles of my heart that someone who was so arrogant and selfish from the beginning, could turn into someone who looks at the big picture and realizes that there's some enjoyment to be had. It's the adage of ""live, laugh, love"" that carries Mayonaka Punch and makes the utmost difference from the time-pressurized plot of a million subs, against the journey to reach that goal itself, which says more than your average show that does it all, and ultimately came down to nothing. I'm looking at you, Na Nare Hana Nare, the other P.A. Works show that tries so hard that it fails at even doing something right.

Out of all 3 P.A. Works shows this Summer season, Mayonaka Punch definitely has its own quirks, being a dark, but not too gritty premise that director Shu Honma took his expertise from Ya Boy! Kongming and flex it all the more with his only 2nd directorial series, and it shows how venturous he can go when the sky's the limit (a pun on vampires not being able to fly too high that ordinary humans can spot them). Similar to Fall 2022's Akiba Meido Sensou a.k.a Akiba Maid War, P.A. Works going the far end to produce another show in a similar vein does give the anime quite the trajectory that you would not expect to see from the studio itself. I would love more experimental series from the studio itself, if given the producers chance to ""exploit"" P.A. Works and show off more than just the bright-coloured nuances that we're so used to these days.

The OST is interesting enough, though there's one flaw, and that's not having enough of it. While the OP goes for the pimp of the current trend of video content done bombasticly to a degree that it doesn't feel crowded at all, thankfully, it's the ED that captured my attention all the more, because making a song out of commentary speech is not easy, and Masaki's VA Ikumi Hasegawa nailed that perfectly.

While not being on the same insanity level that is VTuber Legend, Mayonaka Punch honestly doesn't need to tip-toe with the rivalry despite showcasing similar content, and is still, at the end of the day, a series that demands another look if you've given it the pass at the beginning. It may feel undercooked at the beginning, but it's all done with intention that makes you feel feelings of humanity restored and the hidden potential that the series will eventually cook to become a competent series. I too had doubts about the series being on its two feet at the start, but it slowly dawned on me that characterization can still make or break the show, and Mayonaka Punch deserves that underrated recognition.

Crazy or not, Mayonaka Punch is a show that's not just all about the whack, but also about trusting people to enjoy the process together. And honestly, it's warranted."
57947,538094.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"The plot at the beginning is quite common this year, where the main character has some kind of problem with her friends or family and wants to achieve a big goal of her own to prove herself. (Like Jellyfish Can't Swim in the Night and Girls Band Cry, which air in 2024 like this anime.) But some things are unpredictable, partly because it's an original anime. I was impressed with many scenes and it was more fun than I thought. The visuals are quite good, easy on the eyes, the night scenes aren't too dark, and the work isn't rushed. The songs fit the situations and feelingsof the characters. For example, the opening song describes the vampires of MayoPan having a fun party at night, while the ending song describes Masaki's feelings during the day when she's working alone editing videos for the channel, filled with loneliness and pain. And she wanted to fix that feeling like editing a video. I really love the opening and ending songs of this anime. I've listened to every opening and ending song of this anime more than 20 times.

The personalities of the characters in the story are charming and interesting. But some characters are quite annoying and have pretty bad personalities, but have character development. It gave me a better feeling for the characters.

Overall, The beginning of the anime seems ordinary, but after that, it becomes very fun and interesting. The staff and cast are very attentive and dedicated to this work. This is another anime that is recommended to watch."

That said, it never became my favorite and while I liked it, I wasn't thinking about how I couldn't wait for the next episode. I think it was a really solid 6/10 and definitely worth the watch. I would also watch more if there was another season. So, if you're looking for a neat little vampire story set in the modern era, then you'll likely enjoy this. If you want an anime that has a little more punch to it, a little more extra something, then you might alsofind it to be a very solid 6/10."
57947,538264.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"It’s time to break the rule of “avoid telling how you came to watch” because, goddammit, this is a special case and I dare MAL and everyone on it to challenge that. Less than an hour before I started writing this review, I learned that Nicholas Dupree of Anime News Network, who wrote the weekly reviews for Mayonaka Punch and thus brought me to this series, tragically passed away at the very young age of 31. I had been reading those weekly entries and noted with concern his recent mentioning of being in poor health. With that revelation, the surprise factor of reading his dedicated“In Memoriam” page on ANN was mitigated… and replaced with a gut punch. I could not help but feel a little piece of myself shatter because I really loved the personality of his writing, but I cannot, of course, feel anything close to the heartbreak his friends and family must be suffering. I wish mercy and patience upon all of you who knew him personally. May he rest in peace.

I’m not the kind of seasonal anime viewer who gives every show a shot and it is for this reason I put a decent amount of value on reviews of new anime, mainly those from ANN. So, when Mr. Dupree saw fit to label Mayonaka Punch as a bright, if overshadowed, entry this season on account of it having an engaging understanding of YouTube and internet culture, I was intrigued and checked it out. 

I really must thank him from the bottom of my heart. I would never have given this show a second glance if I hadn’t read that review. But because it was there for me to read, I was ultimately afforded the opportunity to enjoy something that I found funny, cute, genuinely heartfelt, and rather beautiful. 

And, make no mistake, this is a series to enjoy subjectively more than any other way. Yes, that is largely because some jokes won’t land depending on the audience (though they generally did for me), but I mean this through the dramatic scope as well. Beneath the veneer of YouTuber-themed comedic hijinks starring a bunch of vampires because why not, Mayonaka Punch is a character study about a woman who can’t contain her ego, doesn’t know how to heal from her past experiences, and, like most loners, is desperate for a family to love her.

While most of that has been done, even in anime, what set this series apart for me was the heroine’s age; Masaki is in her twenties meaning she is well past her immature high school days and is supposed to have her life together by this point. Instead, the show opens with her having tanked her “NewTube” career in a single fell swoop and now spending her time meticulously reading all manner of mean-spirited comments about her before continuing to hurt herself by getting hammered in a bar and walking around drunk. A state of abject immaturity-borne misery like this is among the best ways to start a story that is ultimately about learning to be kind to and honest with oneself.

The Masaki we observe in this opening is incapable of maintaining relationships with people. If she hadn’t fluked her way into finding the vampires, she’d probably become an alcoholic, continuing to deny her own flaws and insisting that she did nothing wrong all while knowing the truth deep down and hating herself for it. There is a problem with Masaki’s characterization, however, and that pertains to the series’ pacing. It is true that we get insights into Masaki’s personality over the show’s course; the episode where she argues with the team about the right way to edit the videos is a highlight in that it puts front and center both Masaki’s ego-centric inflexibility and mean streak. However, I felt that Mayonaka Punch fell short in refusing to clarify until episode 9 that Masaki always struggled with making and keeping friends. Introversion is a pretty important trait given this character’s story; leaving it out removed a lot of interesting nuance for most of the show’s run, at which point its reveal almost feels like too little, too late on that front. This is someone who wants friends and a family but can’t stand being around other people, probably mostly out of fear. No doubt many a viewer can relate to this; I know I certainly do.

But it would be wrong to harp on the pacing of the dramatic character writing because I found Mayonaka Punch to be veritably packed to the gills with fun moments and jokes. I had a great time watching this series and I feel it balances the comedy and drama particularly well in that it allows for the impactful moments to send the audience reeling after being disarmed by good-natured fun and earnest idiocy.

A single word that can be used to summarize Mayonaka Punch would be “sincere”, and, coming off of Oregairu, it’s a welcome breath of soothing, kind-hearted air. I hope you all enjoy it at least as much as I did!

Happy watching!

57947,538164.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Fun, bright, adorable, and hilarious. Mayonaka Punch is a truly refreshing anime about vampires led by a human to become video content creators that allows its absurdity to ground the audience as not only a fan of the anime but also as a fan of MayoPan. This isn’t a long review so I’ll go over the main points outside of its story first: - Banger OP. The OP had me excited for every single episode because it really allows you to have a song you could actually dance to, and the visuals really made you realize how cool it would be for indestructible vampires to do verydangerous high energy stunts and alternate them with cute dances. 
- Art was very good and felt like it paid homage to older cutesy popular vampire anime like chibi vampire (despite the lack chibis here). Consistent fluid animation that never felt like budget was really sacrificed.
- Characters and Vampire Characteristics all felt very unique and catered to make it so everyone would have a “best girl” with the clear favorite for Live. Each character also felt fleshed out in a way that felt like they lived in this world with their own history so they weren’t just there to be there.
- My favorite of all however was the story and “friendship/romance” between best vamp Live and our favorite behind the scenes human Masaki. No spoilers but the reasoning for starting the channel, the mental conflicts and our characters’ flaws all allow you to root for them and it never felt like a rushed thing. Even the Newtubing didn’t truly start till episode 3 or 4 as the initial roadblocks were a significant key part of the story. This made non of the comedy feel forced or events glossed over for the jokes but it also keeps you invested in the characters.

Overall Mayonaka Punch was a surprisingly great watch for this season. I believe this is a great anime to take a break from watching anything serious or grave. High recommend!"
57947,540099.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Mayonaka Punch is a surprisingly well structured anime despite it seeming like it was trying to cram in too many characters into a 12 episode season. First of all, I just love Masaki's character development. It's very thought out and as a result, Masaki is a beloved character. The first thing we get to know about Masaki is that she violently punched her fellow co-streamers when they were all livestreaming. And that's it. We don't see the buildup, and we only get a few vague reasons why it could have developed to that point. But, it's not shown. And I love that. Because ultimately, does itmatter? The reason for Masaki punching her fellow Hype-Sisters doesn't matter. The thing that matters is that Masaki is thrown into internet drama, hate, and separates from Hype-Sisters as a result. She can't record herself due to her anxiety about online comments.

The next time we see Masaki talking about herself, it's not just about a random flashback to get the viewers to understand the main character. Instead, it's because she's frustrated with herself and self-aware about her attitude sometimes. With her dreams of making a big NewTube channel over, she's torn. But because Live wants to helps, loves her, and potentially because Masaki wanted to let it off her chest, she starts telling Live about herself. Her past. It's not just some omniscient viewpoint of the viewer learning about some random flashback, it narratively makes sense since Masaki is actually explaining her past to somebody else.

Ultimately, with help and support through the entire season, whether it be from her family, her former co-NewTubers Hype Sisters, and of course, the Mayonaka Punch crew, Masaki battles the urge to want to be on camera and the anxiety that comes with it. It's not just people saying ""just stop thinking about it!"" It's not just about Masaki ""summoning the courage."" But it's about Masaki slowly warming up to the idea with supporting friends while also being forced eventually confront herself and her own feelings about being on camera. This subplot about Masaki and relationship with NewTube, showing her face, and wanting to be accepted by the internet community is quite brilliant for an anime original, and it's all you need to know about the quality about the rest of the show.

It's above average in most things: the melodrama, the characters, the art, and the plot as well. One thing that was clearly lacking was some of the character development for side characters, especially the likes of Tokage, which felt like the story just didn't really focus on her at all due to the lack of episodes in the show. This definitely hampers the character interaction and cohesion, but with a good foundation with Masaki, Live, and Ichiko, the other side characters fit in fine. Thus, a solid 7/10. Worth a watch




Random Aside about Girls Band Cry -- feel free to ignore if you haven't watched that show:

I'll compare this with Girls Band Cry just because both are similar in having a low self-esteem MC, proactive second lead trying to help the MC out, and both trying to make it big in the entertainment world, but the execution can't be anymore different. 
Nina comes from a similar spot with Masaki. Masaki runs away--gets pushed aside by the Hype Sisters and moves out. Nina's running away from home, going to school in Tokyo because she couldn't stand her family and living environment. With not so subtle flashbacks, we understand Nina was bullied and can't interact with others. Momaka, her idol, notices Nina and wants to form a band with her-- very similar to how Live is proactively pursuing Masaki and wants to create a NewTube channel with her. However, the similarities stop there.

What's even the reason for Nina to not want to form a band? Low anxiety or whatever. Umm, Nina then proceeds to have melodrama with her other bandmate and makes up within an episode. 3-4 episodes later she's encouraging other people, and somehow Nina basically fundamentally transforms as a character and all it takes is Momoka to give her pep talk for two episodes. It's so much more flat than the more realistic timeline and journey Masaki goes through. Plus, no matter how you slice it, shoving crappy flashbacks about Nina's past to supplement character development is just low effort. Despite Mayonaka punch being more lighthearted, less drama heavy, and about damned vampires, the character development regarding Masaki is much more prominent than Nina in a show that's more serious, melodramatic, and supposedly all about character development."
57947,538115.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"This series did a lot more with its premise than I expected going in. The idea of a very extra set of vampire girls teaming up with a cancelled NewTuber to get a million subs on the promise that one of said vampires will drink said NewTuber dry of her blood sounds like fun, and the way the show portrays doom scrolling through negative comments really conveys the feeling well, including how it shuts you off from the world around you. If that was all it was, I’m sure this show would have been a fun watch. It turned out that the writers had morein store, and though I believe the added elements were worth the effort does improve on the final product, the mix of what they present ends up a bit tonally dissonant.
 
As would be expected, much of the show is goofy with an edge of sincerity to it, placing mostly the vampiric characters in circumstances where they either use their powers or are hampered by the weaknesses of being vampires, and/or focusing on the next attempt at gaining more subscribers.
 
Sometimes, though, it takes a dip into a more sincere plot, providing more character depth to one of the vampiric girls, and the strength of these is not so much in finding a strong emotional core to these character (though they do), nor that that core is associated with their vampiric immortality, but rather that it’s tied to elements of that immortality that aren’t often touched upon. Fu’s and Ichiko’s stories in particular really shine in this regard.
 
And that’s the groove I fell into with this series, expecting it to build on these elements while giving more depth to other characters. It was nice to see how the series used Masaki’s sister to great effect to give us insight into her background as well, and nicer still to see that their relationship wasn’t black and white. Maybe if this gets a season two, we’ll get more of those insights into some of the longer-lived vampires, but for now, we get a solid finale with a neat (if expected) twist that brings the season together nicely.

I enjoyed the run. It’s more fun than it is emotionally powerful, but I definitely enjoyed the ride, even if I would have preferred another couple of character deep dives."
57947,540264.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Overall, Mayonaka Punch is a fun watch, but it's nothing extraordinary. The story itself is pretty simple, and the real highlight lies in its comedic moments, which focus on the quirky personalities of the characters. While the drama doesn’t add much depth, it also doesn’t detract from the experience. One of the standout elements is the opening, which is really catchy and sets a great tone. As for the ending, it wraps things up in a way that makes the journey worthwhile. Its a simple but kinda fun ride, a ride that is focused on this very troubled girl called Masaki, who now fear the simpleact of showing up in the camera."
57947,538090.0,3.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Mayonaka Punch seems like a weak attempt at trying to portray content creators with their own spin on it. I don't mind a series that wants to be quirky or have eccentric characters take up the spotlight, but sometimes, it can be taken a bit too far when you don't attempt to keep your characters and script up in check, especially when the show is original work. I'm no stranger to P.A Works' blunders, but they have made some good original works in the past which I had fun watching. Unfortunately, this show feels so lackluster compared to the director's previous work on Paripi Koumei,proof you can make a show about getting fame in the entertainment industry ENTERTAINING to watch.

The show tries to sell you a story about making content in the nightlife with its vibrancy of colors, the animation and art are consistent and don't take any shortcuts, you get a solid cast with distinguishable characters that have different designs and easy to recognize. It has all of these in check and is usually a good mark to mark a good original show. But how reality often disappoints.

I think the show's problem probably starts from the characters, look at Masaki. A canceled member of a popular NewTube channel because she got caught in 4K punching her friend. How do you make someone who's prone to rude remarks or violence likable to watch? Just put her in a room filled with nutjobs who also happened to be vampires and have her manage that team to become the next sensation of the platform that once canceled her. It's a bold attempt at making someone who actually did something wrong the focus of the show, but making her being in an environment where nobody can really connect to Masaki without resorting to contrived storytelling or deus ex machinas is just a recipe for a bad show. It's difficult to find meaningful moments because of the disharmony between characters exist.

Continuing to the character's problem, I genuinely felt more disappointed because it had a couple of decent characters that I would love to see more, but held back by the series' subpar script and story. Let me focus on Yuki for a minute, she otherwise would appear as a strict vampire who tried to uphold the secrecy of their own existence, but her voice being Kayano Ai and the voice lines she had were pretty good! I would love to have more of her taking up screen time and being more focused other than the script's decision to haphazardly use her as a comic relief for the vampire nutjobs such as Live and her gang. I made an exception for Fuu because her role was just acceptable and didn't have any issues watching her. Live was a giant issue, it hurts for me to watch, because I love the voice actress, but her lines and character role just didn't sit well with me as I had to tolerate her antics in most of the episode. Tokage was genuinely difficult to watch because she's pretty much a gambling addict on paper and barely got development other than her reacting to the weird things the show propelled her in. Ichiko initially was annoying to bear with but got more tolerable as time went on.

Let's talk about the story, it's pretty bland, as if it couldn't be more obvious. Other than a few episodes where the endings change with the VAs singing (which stuff actually does happen on those rare occasions), it's mostly trying to show Masaki's new group producing content to garner views and subs to work on the 1 million milestone, but here I am, trying to ask you this, do NewTubers act like what was shown on Mayonaka Punch? I get other creators act differently than the usual creators we are exposed to like commentators, reaction channels, vlogs, challenges, or music covers, but anything that this show tries to copy, it feels mild at best and mediocre. The execution leaves so much to be desired and I can't help but groan when the only thing the show did right to portray was the comments you sometimes find on your videos or such.

I was hoping for a better portrayal of media creators. But I guess this is where their staff could only do at the end. There's really not much to say other than it being bland and forgettable. Your new run-of-the-mill product by P.A Works unfortunately ends here.

Thank you for reading."
55844,537663.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"In some way I feel bad to give such a low score and I know a lot of people gonna think I’m way to harsh but lets talk about it and a little bit about manga because its important for this anime. Tasogare Out Focus Is a combination of four different mangas written by same author. Its like a Tetralogy. With the every manga expect the last one about a different couple. They are all one volume and contains 7 to 9 chapters. So all of them pretty short and this is the biggest problem. There are to many things happening to them being short stories. Wehave three couples that have 7 chapters to start a relationship, have a interesting story and develop a relationship which is not enough. After this part I’m gonna talk about anime.

Same think happens even worse in the anime for me. Couples felt empty because I have 5 episodes for first couple,  4 or 3 I dont remember for the second and 3 for the last one. Oh and 1 ep for kind of for everyone.What kind of opinion I should get on them ? Because of it Im gonna talk about every couple like its a different anime.

1st Couple (ep 1-4 , 11-12): Hisashi and Mao its the couple we see on poster and kind of the main one. As a relationship trope they are friends to lovers. We have Hisashi a very handsome but cold boy and Mao a student who loves to shoot movies. The story is mostly happens in dorm because they are roommates.One that Mao learns that Hisashi is gay and he promised to keep it in secret and Hisashi promises to not feel in love with him. My biggest problem with this couple is them being lost opportunity. They are the couple that had a change to get a deeper and interesting story but didn’t well because ehem 5 ep. We did have a change to talk about grooming, opening himself to others, p*do*lia etc. but we don't, everything just get brushed under the carpet. Thanks for it. The only think that were opened in story is finding what you interest in which it was done great .But What was the point of showing serious topics to just forget about them.. For me it just bad writing. Same with dialogues a lot of dialogues were just cringe for me and maybe its just me feeling this way but Evertime writer didn't know how to counting the scene we get a bed scene. Even when they talked about their feelings and what they worried about we just end-up in bed scene.Not the worst couple and did have a great potential but we never gonna see it so 5/10

2nd Couple (ep 5 - 7) :Ichikawa and Jin, second couple and my favorite. Their trope was enemies to lovers.  Ichikawa is the second year director of the film clubs very passionate about films but have a very short temper. And Jin is the third year director and president of the film club. He is very popular in the school, very put together. But they are not getting along. In the series we see their relationship change them become more close and open to each other about film making and understanding each other. I like them they have chemistry and even tho actually they have the cringiest story I enjoyed it the most. They just work. Again 4 episode is not enough and I wanted more development but it is what it is 6.5/10

3rd Couple (8- 10): Rei and Shion they are my least favorite as a couple but I like the story more then first if its make sense. As a trope its kind of Grumpy and sunshine mixing with fake dating. Shion was annoying to me in the first episode and thinking that we just have 3 ep with Its to much for me. He is someone who wants to find boyfriend. Its he’s only goal in the world. In the end he find himself in film club where is Rei is the scenarist. He is a cold and kind of mean workaholic who only cares about making film. They dont get along at first but end up in some kind of half fake dating scenerio. Im not sure how to explain it.And we see their relationship getting stronger and them feel in love which each other. Finding what they passionate about and changing perspective in life. Like I say not the worst story I just dont like the couple. I just felt bored watching them and for me it can be  more interesting if they have different partners.


So for me it was 2nd &gt; 1st &gt; 3rd

As a good part I can mention that the film club was done great. We actually did have a lot of great moment. How people finding what they into and about their passions. I enjoyed this part. The animation was not bed not my favorite style of drawing but Im sure a lot of people gonna enjoy it. There were cute and heartwarming moments. We dont have abuse in the series between the main couple which is well a great accomplishment in Yaoi genre. As a SA scene which is again very popular in Yaoi genre. There is one that can get interacted as one. I think its just really bed writing because the author well not great at it. But still it there is one so if you don't like it and don't wanna see it. Watch it knowing this information.

Well if you wanna watch a cute Yaoi I still think you should watch it . Its pretty okay. Just not what I want.Its not the worst one I see its just that I think its the biggest lost opportunity I did see in a long time"
55844,538639.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Before starting Twilight Out of Focus, it’s important to know that there’s not really a “main” couple. The series is pretty evenly split between 3 separate couples, all with their own storylines. Because of this, this series is definitely not a slowburn, as each storyline is 3-4 episodes. Taking all that into account, Twilight Out of Focus is a great series, full of green flags, healthy relationships, and interesting characters with their own distinct personalities. It’s cute, it’s fluffy, and also a little spicy - which in my opinion is realistic considering these are all high school boys. If you want a cute, non-toxic, fastpaced BL, I’d highly recommend this one."
55844,537764.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"With how much toxic relationships seen in BL series, its refreshing to see a show that portrays a healthy BL relationship (relative to popular manga/webtoons). It was a great watch from start to finish; the only gripe I had on it was the show not focusing enough on the main couple (which the hypnosis and cover art suggests). The show goes into three couples including the main one, and gets a little lost a long the way. It does recoup at the end. The show doesn't focus on sex only. It mostly focuses on the daily lives of the characters being in the film club.We get to see their struggles and how they share a passion for filmmaking. It's a solid watch. The OST is good. The VAs did a great job."
55844,537622.0,6.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Twilight Out of Focus - One place, three different stories, but...GAY. If you didn't know already, Boys Love a.k.a BL shows have existed just as long as other most recognizable AniManga genres do, but in the age of the 2020s, cancel culture is so rampant for people to get nosy-ticklish to cancel shows that are regarded as outrageous and oh-so-out of control. Yet, that is unfortunately the case for mangaka Janome's Tasogare Out Focus a.k.a Twilight Out of Focus, being the subject of litigation of X/Twitter's unnecessary heated fire from homophobes, so much so that stupid old Sony-owned Crunchyroll pretty much nuked the comments section insteadof hiring moderators to fish out the bot accounts that are spreading the misogyny of BL anime. That's a first that the show was unfortunately crowned for, and it's sad that people are just getting too sensitive about BL works, the irony that the genre has outlived these exact same homophobes being cringe just to see guys kissing as a form of sexual coercion. Like, come on.

With all of the misogyny out of the way, let's tackle the anime, which holds itself in a very unique position of not just adapting said manga, but more so like a collection of short stories, combined all into one work.

For a long time now, having watched BL shows, as a old-enough guy who can appreciate BL works like Winter 2022's Sasaki and Miyano series (the main couple and the side Hirano and Kagiura couple, which was made into a decent movie) and last season's Tadaima, Okaeri a.k.a Welcome Home, I was having expectations going into Tasogare Out Focus considering it's Studio Deen, and the review that I made for the latter series was still pretty much holding true that I could just copy-paste my exact thoughts, but whatever.

As I've eluded early in the review, Tasogare Out Focus is a collection of short stories that all take place in a boys-only school, and specifically in the film club, split into the respective 1st to 3rd years of the young adult men wanting to achieve something out of their ordinary lives, after hearing the film club's dedication to the new project of creating a BL film and marketing it to the masses. To be more explicit, the anime adaptation of the manga is as follows:

Main story:
Volume 1 - Twilight Out of Focus - covering the story of 2nd year roommates Mao Tsuchiya and Hisashi Otomo
Volume 3 - Twilight Out of Focus: Overlap - covering the story of the film club's leaders of 3rd year Jin Kikuchihara and 2nd year Giichi Ichikawa

Side story:
Volume 2 - Twilight Out of Focus: Afterimages in Slow Motion - covering the story of the newly joined 1st year Shion Yoshino and the ignorant playboy of 3rd year Rei Inaba
Volume 4 - Twilight Out of Focus: The Evening Monologues - the recap of all 3 couples in their various levels of relationship

The insights of the 3 central gay couples will undoubtedly unfold different aspects of the film club and its BL film creation moments, though everything else is what you should expect coming into a BL show like this, which doesn't shy away from aspects like sexual assault. The difference with Tasogare is that mangaka Janome handles each couple in a very realistic and mature way, that as much as you want to call it for BL being romanticized by authors who just want their fantasies displayed, he does the formula so different that it's unlike many of the stereotypical works where reality is always shied away from and not being used to its full potential, citing real-world views. Situations like being forced into love just because of circumstances or anything, people will tend to see it as sexual assault or coercion, but this show does in a way that, as much as the as the assumption of the red flags you're going to see throughout the series, it however starts off with green flags: from agreements to general rivalry, each couple's starting point is first laid out in an adept way that doesn't cross the line at first, even though one or the other will start to push buttons in a rather realistic, but unconformable, and non-conformative way to either push or pull said couples towards or apart from each other. It's relationship realism, and you can't objectify this based on human perception alone.

The distinctive gay couples get their own spotlight by doing things that would benefit one or the other: Mao getting his roommate Hisashi to join the film club and do something about his life; Ichikawa's rivalry with Jin being so strong enough to elude feelings over their competitive nature; and Shion discovering true love for the first time with the unperceptive Rei, who thinks that dating and romance are a joke. That's what compels good characterization, not just on the pure romantic side, but with a human-level of weight to be productive as normal human beings for a sense of purpose. And I appreciate that about a show like this trying to tackle both the comfortable and uncomfortable sides of the relationship, as depictive as real life can be.

I've said this before, and I'll say it again: Studio Deen IS the studio to go for BL shows, and while Tasogare looks less refined than both Sasaki to Miyano and Tadaima, Okaeri, it still is presentable for what it is, especially the scenes where film cinematography is utilized and gives the show a whole lot of substance other than its BL features. But overall, it's good.

The music is honestly the weakest link of the anime. The OST is just there being enough, and while Ikusaburou Yamazaki's OP is that of your typical J-Pop decent but forgettable song, Amber's ED sounds surprisingly great and fantastic.

Despite the clear NC-17 to R-21 ratings worth of maturity to the show, I find that Tasogare Out Focus a.k.a Twilight Out Of Focus is a rather compelling show if you want some mature and undisguised BL, even if it reeks the hell of prior review-bombing that it sadly got. It's just not for me to experience gut-wrenching shows like this, especially since it makes you question how far AniManga authors like Janome push the boundary of what's considered to be too crass for the genre itself, especially for a niche genre that has gotten the love-hate treatment in recent years.

It's solid with intentionality that's handled gracefully, I'll give it as much that."
55844,537729.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I really appreciated this series and found it to be so unapologetically gay and cute and fun! It is so refreshing to see a BL or even a story with gay characters where there wasn't really a single implied moment of homophobia in the setting of the world. It just set a stage with great pieces and let it play out in a light-hearted and entertaining way that made me feel good every time I watched it. First though: --- my big critique is with how the show starts very early on. There is one interaction that is very uncomfortable and immediately had me on myred flags drawn type of viewing. I was wondering if we were going Banana Fish-level trauma or sub-5.0 rating yaoi dumpster bin. Luckily it spins out of that interaction pretty fast. And while it does help build one of the lead characters story, looking back it really doesn't fit the tone of the show. Immediately thinking this was going to be one of those BL I force myself to sit thru until things go so left I finally drop it. ---

That said! +++ The great thing is that right after that bumpy start with a past acquaintance, they introduce a much more pleasant and engaging setting and new quirky characters with realistic interactions, but still told in a lighthearted after-dinner anime watch style. Relating to my own experiences, I found everything underneath to be so well-written and relatable to real life gay world existing, growing up and figuring yourself out, finding love and questioning yourself and questioning people around you and potential interests. Just human relationships in general, in pursuing and trust and doubt and discovery and revelation. It all is low-key written really well for how lite it comes across. +++

Without spoiling, the different character interactions offer such a nice change of pace episode to episode. It can be such a tone-shift going from one couple to the next, and I absolutely loooooove one of these characters and how they present him as. It's one of my laughably favorite presentations of a gay man in all of anime and I should add him to my favs right now actually.

As a BL fan, this just fit a certain spot in my heart I appreciated. It's all so unserious but with great care and detail still felt within it. This probably won't be in my top top for this year by any means, and you can find deeper stories out there for sure (Tian Guan Ci Fu from this year being one of them) but it really is one of the most enjoyable BL I have watched. (And I have watched... a looooot...) A nice casual evening watch. And after that little initial stumble in the beginning, I am so happy that I stuck with this.

It was so enjoyable and hopefully signals more great BL storytelling in anime like this in the future. I'm always refreshing that boys love tab on anime search hoping a new series gets announced that looks like an actual good story. This was one of those for sure.

Ratingbomb-haters have a nice day and stop missin out on life! ;)

I have no complaint and love the relationship progression of ALL the characters as it just feels so healthy and sooo damn sweet.watch."
55844,539199.0,8.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"I loved the manga, but i'm not so sure about the anime. First of all, this is an adapptation of a manga series in which each volume tells the story of 4 different couples. And the anime thought they could tell their stories well in 12 episodes. Honestly, this felt more like a motion manga than an anime in itself; I'm not really sure how to express myself on that one. Second, since the original source material has kind of short stories for the couples it didn't feel rushed or anything. I liked the pacing, but this anime... I don't know, it felt kind of off? I'mnot sure, it felt like there was something missing, but I'm not sure what.
Third, despite all of what i said, I enjoyed watching this. Wish it was a bit longer, maybe that way the story could be more well developed, but I'm just another person watching another anime. I know nothing on production, I just say what I felt and that's it."
55844,539948.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"TL;DR – if you’re a gay man who loves anime, or if you like any romance-oriented anime, watch this. It’s not quite as good as Given, but it’s also miles better than Gravitation. This anime breaks ground in ways rarely seen in yaio/BL, and usually avoids tropes. There's even a nice post-credits scene on the last episode. Just don't expect twilight to come into focus. This is the third time I’ve written/updated my review. I know, I said I probably wouldn’t update it, but the final episodes compelled me to log in and give another hot take. This is a long review, because I had myexpectations set really high by the backlash Crunchyroll faced when they announced this, and by the first 4 episodes. The episodes featuring Mao and Hisashi are by far the strongest episodes, and they feel realistic, as if a man in his mid or late 20s is recounting a story about his first love. The other episodes featuring the other two couples are much weaker and I feel they undermined the quality of the show. They're not *bad* but they just felt so unnecessary.

I’m approaching this anime with a few perspectives – I’m a gay American man who loves anime, I’m a sucker for at least giving any anime with an LGBT character a chance, this anime was supposed to be controversial, and I’m fully aware that being a gay or trans person in Japan is taboo AF.

There’s not many *good* anime out there centered on LGBT characters. Calm down, you know it’s true! I said what I said!
There’s Ghost in the Shell SAC (Major might be a lesbian? Maybe bi? It’s not really confirmed), Tokyo Godfathers (I love you, Hana!), Given, Yuri on Ice, and Stranger by the Shore are all that come to mind, and GitS is a real reach by me. I am happy to add Twilight Out of Focus to this list too.

By today’s standards, stuff like Gravitation and Junjo Romantica are just bad, and weird. When I was younger, long before we had stuff like Given and Yuri, these seemed great because there were literally no other options to see an entire anime with characters who had something so deeply in common with me. The menu has expanded a bit since then.

I’d love to see LGBT characters just occur organically and unforced within anime (where’s my gay Vash or Goku?) but Japan just isn’t there yet. The taboo around LGBT folks in Japan has lead to these characters only rarely being portrayed, and usually as a stereotype – either silly comic relief or flamboyant and creepy (Hisoka Morow from Hunter X Hunter anyone?).

Twilight Out of Focus is rumored to be the show which caused Sony to remove all commenting from Crunchyroll – people are *that* bigoted, so naturally I had to watch it to see what made Twilight Out of Focus more edgy than something like Mnemosyne. With that in mind, I’m honestly disappointed. The opening is meh, nothing offensive, graphic, edgy… Heartwarming in a lightly cringey way? Cute even. In fact, this isn’t anything we have not already seen in other shows such as Yuri on Ice, or Given, which is not a bad thing, but seeing similar plots repeatedly does grow tiresome. It’s 2024, Japan, give us the gay anime which our parched souls are crying out for!

Now, hold on. I must be fair! This show opens with a character being acknowledged as a closeted gay man. Yes, “gay” not “uwu he’s cute and I don’t know why I feel this way! Wait, where are you putting that, senpai?! uuwwuuu!!!” This alone feels very groundbreaking to me, and I actually skipped the video back to hear it a second time. “Wait, did he just say he is…?!” Yes, and that alone is actually laudable.

Also, there are s3x scenes! Not pervy pr0n stuff, it's tastefully done. Sure, we've seen gay s3x scenes eons ago (Cowboy Bebop had Faye burst in on one), but this is presented as romance, not go-to-horny-jail stuff. This again feels very groundbreaking.
Nothing is implied, hinted at, or just left to be explained in a manga we’ll never read. It’s right there in the open. I believe this is the first time I’ve seen an anime character saying, “I’m gay” vs. them carrying on with men, but never saying the obvious, or finding themselves bedding a woman back in “real life” when they step away from their male lover escapade (pretty sure I’m looking at you, Gravitation or Junjou Romantica!). It's a very nice change.

As another reviewer pointed out - this show is also refreshing because it portrays the traditional BL/anime SA/PDF File relationships for what they are - gross and wrong. Gravitation and Great Teacher Onizuka, this is *not* (and let's be real, GTA wouldn't be able to air today). While I was tempted to point to a manga by an artist named Mikiko Crash'n'Burn as a point of comparison to Twilight Out of Focus or Given, it also opens with some light SA which is a very unfortunate trope, especially in BL. Tops are not just grabbing up waiflike men off the street and laying the pipe, FFS.

The English voice acting is very well done (most of the time – some stuff is toned down from the Japanese sub). The tone is usually serious, but there are melodramatic moments in the writing and animation which feel jarring to me, akin to Vash in Trigun skittering across the sand and making snarky cat faces with no warning, or some of the more animated moments of Fullmetal Alchemist.
The characters… From the trailer, I knew that we would have multiple couples, which is kind of a trope with this genre. I’m not a huge fan of that, I’m happy with one couple vs. the entire cast suddenly tripping and landing on a chopstick, but it is what it is. Having several couples at once works fine in many shows, but here it felt like the writer was much more invested in Mao and Hisashi while the other two couples were an after thought to pad out the run time.

The pairing for Mao and Hisashi is very non-conventional for a yaoi, a serious tone is set and the two characters rapidly become multi-dimensional. They feel the closest to being “real” to me out of the six total POV characters, but the remaining characters don't manage to clear the bar set in the first act.

The second pairing is very on the nose for BL (uwu, this feels so nice, but he’s a guy!) and actually involves BL so I feel it’s honest satire. The third pairing is… Somewhere in between the first and second? When the anime arrives at couple #3, you will be greeted by a flamboyant openly gay teen who is absolutely on the prowl. Yaaas, queen, yaaas! He reminds me of those single guys whose only goal in life is to find someone to date. Nothing beyond that is planned, and it’s just not cute. There is character development with him and he does branch out a bit. The other half of this duo is also seemingly openly gay and vapid too, but vapid in the sense of not really caring all that much about affection or even relationships. He's presented with an older mysterious brother vibe in prior episodes, without any mention of having a history of openly dating male classmates, which made a grand reveal moment feel like a retcon when the relationship is revealed no one reacts poorly about it being two males. Definitely some plot armor and lazy writing going on there, IMHO.

The animation is well done, though it definitely has vibes from a previous era of anime radiating through. As stated before, the animation has a serious tone until it doesn’t for a few moments here and there.

The story itself is fine. It’s nothing too magical or out of left field, it’s essentially a high school romance drama with an ambiguous timeline as we shuffle through the 3 “how we met” arcs. The film festival is supposed to be the thread linking all of this together, but ultimately it’s a plot vehicle which seems to end up nowhere. We don't even get to see a supercut of the competing films. The Mao and Hisashi episodes are the best, hands down, and the screen time devoted to the other two couples really prevented the story from flourishing into something more than “how I met my first boyfriend” recollections, imo. Hell, the three couples don’t even cross paths outside of school and for all we the viewers know, they’re oblivious to each other’s existence, which just makes having multiple couples in the anime feel like a waste of time.

Final verdict – Opening the show with a new presentation for LGBT characters set the bar a little too high for episodes contained within other arcs, dragging down the overall quality of the show and depriving the story of anything truly meaningful, but ultimately the disparity between how later POV characters are presented doesn't undermine the *goodwill* earned in the first 4 episodes. The groundbreaking pushes my score up from a 7 to an 8. Yes, this is worth watching, just don’t expect twilight to come into focus."
55844,537629.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"I was really excited about this one. It started off strong but gradually lost its way. The original story line about the two roommates seems to have been completely sidelined. Instead, the focus has shifted to multiple couples and completely forgetting about the first couple. My question to this is WHY? The original couple was cute and had a nice banter but everything else was a mess and, to be honest, boring. I started watching because of the original couple but after their episodes all I got was a lot of back-and-forth. Not even sure if I can recommend this if I simple enjoyed a certainpart of it."
55844,537653.0,8.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"""Mixed Feelings"" recommendation is mostly because there is a LOT of sex (it's 13+ appropriate but damn). I personally understand why there is so much, and everything around it is super nice, but personally not a sex person. Another major downside is very brief reference to pedophilia and statutory rape which pisses me off greatly, but is very brief problem and minor point of the show, but has value as unfortunately that issue does genuinely exist in the real world (woodchippers... where they belong). I think this may have been my first dedicated BL, and see why so many people love them. Content: Some may argue, especiallyfor the main couple, it's kind of meh/generic, but I loved it! To solve this issue, this has more than one love story!!! Each being unique in their own way and super &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3. We get multiple different kinds of people with a lot revolving around the film club. We get genuine conflicts and genuine resolutions... development. Side characters are pretty nice too.

Style: while it is animated, it felt like was mostly impactful around freeze-frame moments. They kind of obstruct/blur out some borders to give more central focus to multiple shots. The choice of characters designs were really nice and diverse.\

Personal Enjoyment: Outside of the sex, I very much enjoyed it, even those scenes because of all the emotions with them were really nice honestly. Having multiple love stories was amazing and refreshing by preventing stagnation.

If you: Enjoy BL or Romance, I recommend this to you
If you: Don't want to watch BL or don't enjoy romance, I do NOT recommend this to you
If you are: under 13, I do NOT recommend this to you

Same thing I told my kids (Teenagers):
-Don't have sex
-Older people [men] that want to be with you, don't actually think you're ""mature"", beware
-(same guidance to ALL ages) If someone (anyone! including me, your family, teacher, et cetera) is trying to get you to keep a secret or have you do something you don't want, tell a trusted adult!! if that person isn't helping, tell a different one!!!
-No means no
-Don't feel pressured to do anything
-If you do have sex, practice safe sex and get tested, DON'T FEEL PRESSURED OR FORCED!!! SAY NO IF WANT NO!!!"
54835,538593.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Quality Assurance in Another World - Just Isekai and fantasy things, but gone technological to deter bugs, lags and such before its eventual release to the masses. What could possibly go wrong? In the world of video games, computer programs, and the like, I think that the underrated group of unsung heroes who have to always be commended for, are the software engineers. They ensure all the programs we use in our daily lives are free of problems, and that's no easy task given the insanity and complexity of the IT industry to thwart even the smallest of errors that will break the functionality of thefeatures we use on the internet, for better or for worse. And from the mind of someone who prefers supporting roles more than main ones, bringing about the fascination of seeing NPCs move on their own will to want to depict inconspicuous people doing stuff that's meant for players, this is mangaka Masamichi Sato's way of depicting it in Kono Sekai wa Fukanzen Sugiru a.k.a Quality Assurance in Another World, a Sword Art Online derivative that shows a different code of arms than what you might expect.

Ask anyone on the IT side of relevant industries, especially who specializes in software engineering and mainly debugging in general, that it’s a never-ending tedious task to identify areas where bugs and glitches happen in real time enough to be alert 24/7 to issue constant reports and update developers on the never-ending growth of tasks to fix and repair so that the public won’t notice them, nor be affected by the annoying things that affect how the program should operate. This is more so the case for video games, be it console games, or in this case, using VR (virtual reality) to deliver neurotic games. And in this show, the series’ titular MC Makoto Haga is at the helm of doing his job as a debugger for a VRMMO game that is still in quality assurance development mode, until a moment arises that one tries to log out of the game, but they could not do so (a la SAO style) until all the game’s bugs are reported to ensure a safe exit. Down but not out, Haga gets to work with his debugger stone, a tablet that all character debuggers acquire to send their reports to the developers to get the many, countless issues fixed as soon as possible.

The one anomaly, together with Haga, is a young girl named Nikola. Her living in a rural village just outside the borders of the Bayle Kingdom as a designated village girl NPC, she only does the simplest of chores that she’s programmed to do, until a weird-looking dragon comes to thwart the village, rendering Haga’s help as part of the enigmatic investigative squad, the King’s Seekers, to save her out of trouble. But being an NPC, Nikola is only programmed to live and die under the events of the game’s quests itself, so when she lives, breathes, and dies under her village’s event, somehow by hook or by crook, she lived to see the future thereafter of the decimation of her small village by the giant butt-crack-faced dragons, thanks to Haga who put in the effort to save her, even if he knew that she was programmed to invoke death. Forming an unlikely duo after Nikola survived her programmed onslaught, both she and Haga venture onto the game’s vast playing areas, going wherever it takes them: reporting bugs, finding fellow in-game debuggers from other companies, as well as the other elements that make fantasy the genre it is.

As an unusual piece of literature, there’s some originality to be had here in QA Isekai Land. To pen a story about Isekai debuggers, I have to say that Masamichi Sato is a pioneer in this regard, having an Isekai fantasy be centred not so much on the tried-and-true trope of heroes vs. villains (though the show has elements of this for conflicts between fellow debuggers), but of actual professional work that goes into his one-of-a-kind series that hasn’t been explored much in AniManga. Sure, there’s actual video game-inspired series like Shangri-La Frontier that focuses on games that teach about the knows and the don’ts of video game design and balance, but none so much like what this show is doing, focusing on the backend instead with game development. When you add the context of the mangaka’s first serialized work being a short 4-volume series of 2016-2017’s Iron Buddy, which depicts a robot engineer working on his own robot, that even once had a collab with Astro Boy, Masamichi Sato certainly had a hand on being obsessed about the weird, but innovative stuff that no one ever takes a chance with to create something so original, that its Achilles’ Heel is how far this story could go in the long run.

And this story…it’s the weakest aspect of the anime, if I’m being blunt and low-key honest. Sure, Haga’s serious commitment to debugging the game that he’s stuck in at least does feel fresh when in comparison to the character archetypes found in the anime, much less Nikola’s occasional “awakening” moments to deal with evildoers who see the in-game world as a place to do whatever the hell they want to. And what is the tactic, you might say? Nikola’s not just a regular village girl NPC, she’s one of the game’s neurotical consciousness, or the term commonly known as AI, whereby she’s known as Tesla (all you science geeks will know this famed inventor-cum-engineer Nikola Tesla), who is like the in-game mods to micromanage all players and NPCs to decide if they commit evil that’s calls for a ban. As Nikola, she can’t really do much, but as Tesla, the neurotical consciousness only feeds on the players’ debugging stones, which act as their lifeline in the game, and only does so when it detects players acting outside of the game’s justice parameters enough to kill them off in-game, banished to the depths of an endless black hole of blank code. The story can work around both Haga and Nikola alone, but with the focus on other players too (the more prominent ones in the anime being one gang of debugger murderers, as well as a furry debugger and an elf debugger), it just keeps dragging on and on to the point of staleness. The pacing is rather wonky, as well as its tone needing a lot of work with Masamichi Sato writing the series like a novel that despite its simplicity, is overtly too complex for its own good. The characters may be unique (heck, even Nikola as Tesla sure brings out some chuckles), but a little goes a long way, and this cast is definitely on the weird side. 

Moreover, everything else in the anime is just on the thread of being serviceable at best. Studio Palette already had an ousting of Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou, Aruiwa Sekai ga Hajimaru Seisen a.k.a Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World’s sequel in the same Summer 2024 season, delaying the entire sequel up to a point because of production issues, when Silver Link was clearly still working on their current juggernaut that is the ongoing Yozakura-san Chi no Daisakusen a.k.a Mission: Yozakura Family, that the once primary studio had to discreetly wash their hands off the project to hand it over to the rather small studio for production assistance. And with this show being a collab with studio-cum-producer 100studio, it looks nice and alright with a game-like minimalistic art style with not much going for it. Trust me, Studio Palette is still not in the position to run a production house just yet, and giving the small studio 2 shows to work with simultaneously is an utter disaster, as is proven.

The OST is just there, but forgettable at best. Not once did I ever get or feel anything, much less its accompanying OP and ED songs from Liyuu and NACHERRY that were both mediocre to decent.

Sure, as a marketing niche, Kono Sekai wa Fukanzen Sugiru a.k.a Quality Assurance in Another World will speak a lot to the IT engineering Otakus within our midst, and even those who play video games for long to like this show, albeit on a biased level. But regardless of its target audience, this anime is quite the mixed bag for me: it’s enjoyable, but it’s also a slog to sit through at the same time. Ultimately (and ironically enough), as much debugging as the show is worth analyzing from a professional level, regular anime watchers just don’t see it like that, and only come for the entertainment, which, don’t get me wrong, there’s definitely some entertainment to be had, but your mileage will vary."
54835,538781.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"I really wish that I enjoyed this more than I did. At the end of the day, there just wasn’t much here that I enjoyed which is strange for me. To start the art style really doesn’t do a ton for me. It isn’t terrible, and I know there will be people out there who really enjoy the look of this, but I felt like there was way to much juxtaposed imagery for my tastes. The story initially would be interesting of a de-bugger trapped in a video game world, but it quickly runs out of ideas to do with the video game plot. Iteventually runs into a lot of common tropes without a lot of the charm that would typically come from them. The tone is all over the place as well, and I just don’t feel like it has a target audience and instead is just throwing ideas out there. It goes from a pretty innocent and cute plot, then randomly has an episode filled with expletives being bleeped out and strange sexual innuendos. Then the very next episode it acts like it never happened and is right back to kid friendly material. 

Ultimately it just doesn’t work. The idea is interesting to say the least, but I don’t feel like they tapped into the potential. Sure they would likely want to continue this according to the To Be Continued? Line at the end, but I can’t help but be a bit frustrated that they never really wrapped up a single one of its too many loose plot threads knowing that it’s possible it wouldn’t continue. It can be true that the anime is an advertisement to the source material in some cases, but even if this doesn’t get renewed I doubt very seriously that I would be interested in reading on to see what happens."

I wasn't sure what kind of humor I'd encounter when I started watching it since frequently things with plus sized in the title can nose dive into just straight up bullying to audience, but this anime didn't come off like that to me. It came off more like the creator realized that he could draw all the big boobs hewanted if he just made the ladies big too, and I appreciated that.

57845,537877.0,3.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Plus-Sized Elf - Now that's an elf that full of savoury umami...that you don't want to associate with. With elves slowly taking over the anime realm with perfect examples ranging from Sousou no Frieren a.k.a FrierenL Beyond Journey's End's Frieren to Dungeon Meshi's Marcille Donato, the age of the elves taking over anime would be a dream come true, even if by fantasies alone. But sometimes, having a goal sometimes be tripped up by some acid-fueled deterioration, and this would result in some unsatisfactory results, as in the case for Hentai mangaka Synecdoche's Elf-san wa Yaserarenai. a.k.a Plus-Sized Elf. Get this: pair Queen's iconic Bohemian Rhapsody lyricsof ""Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a (plus-sized) landslide, no escape from reality!"" with the combination of a world that's both human and fantasy, and you get a rather unhinged world where humans are typical, and fantasy beings like elves are atypical, maybe even more when they're fat, plus-sized, gluttons. This is the scenario of the osteopathic seitai massage practitioner Tomonatsu Naoe helping to relieve his clients' musculoskeletal systems in the relaxation clinic that is Smiley Boar alongside his director Ahiko Ino, with the latter not realizing that the clients that her co-workers handle aren't quite the human figures they are, ranging from the series' titular female MC Elfuda to mythical creatures like an alraune, ogre and the like. Elfuda's problem is simple: she does not exercise, consumes way too much fat through a rather obsessive addiction to French fries, and seeks help in order to go back to her world through a lift-like mountain apparition that crosses between fantasy and reality. Luckily for her, Naoe is also a dietician since he also preps meal plans for his clients, and the pursuit to lose weight thus begins.

Being as ultra uncensored as it is, I can't help but think that the anime still fails in many regards. First off, if you're the type of person who loves big boobs and the like, you're going to love this show because it literally flashes right in front of your face, and it's quite excessive to a degree that it feels overdone just for the comedic effect. I don't mind the anime operated being a half-episode run series, since most of the manga's stories, while having the semblance of Elfuda's goal and objective to lose weight, cram in as many characters to give diversity not just to Elfuda, but the others...who are also vying for Naoe's human heart...? OK...?

The other characters, say, for example, dark Elf Kuroeda and lycanthrpe Raika, are easily my favourite characters, for the former being a big butt girl and Elfuda's antithesis of natural enemies enough to constantly bicker without fail, and the latter just being fed human food so much that she gained weight just like everyone else. But truth be told, it's a Hentai manga to begin with, so aside from the intentional sexualized poses, nudity, and the like, you want to take as much chance as you can with the human frolicking with as many ""dirty"" people who're just as frenetic as they come. And as they say: two's a company, three's a crowd, and ten or more just feels overcrowded.

Naturally, Hentai works always have a way to bond together, and in the anime's case, it's Hentai studio Elias producing this rather underwhelming show that is a serious degrade over the manga. If you're a man of culture, I shall withhold my opinions, but let's just say that production values are just mediocre in this one. Same goes with the music, it's all white noise and composed rather poorly, even from a famed group like Real Akiba Boyz for the OP collab.

Nope, I just cannot in good faith recommend Hentai anime this bad, even if it uses exercising and promotion of healthy eating as a way of fitness, as a way to form a story out of it. The one good thing that this show has going for when it does is the teaching intention, which I actually quite enjoy for infotainment at times. But then again, if forcing the expose of boobs and private parts is the sole way for Hentai works to gain notoriety, then it's just in-your-face disgust and not respecting its ecchi origin to begin with.

Skip the show and read the manga, winner winner, healthy eating, plain and simple."
57845,538067.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"This anime is very transparent with what it is and who it appeals to, if ya like seeing naked chubby girls then you are likely going to enjoy Plus Size Elf. I am one of those people who likes the squishy girlies, so I enjoyed my time with this anime! Its nice to see a series like this that appeals to an almost never explored demographic. But outside of this niche that the anime was obviously made to appeal to, there is not all that much reason for a general audience to watch this. If I'm being more objective, wouldn't call Plus Size Elf ahorribly bad anime by any means but I also wouldn't call it particularly good either. The main structure of the show works well enough. Naoe, a massage therapist, meets various monster girls from another world who happen to have weight issues and he helps them lose that weight (until they inevitably gain it back). Its a fun setup that creates a nice space to play around with exercising different parts of your body and leads to some mildly entertaining banter as well as the expected ecchi of seeing the girls work out. There is also a surprising amount of genuinely useful workout tips that you could apply in real life which is cool (I will not remember any of them xP). The main problem is that once the monster girls of the week's introductions haven happened, they all kinda get thrown to the side and are rarely seen. There are so many girls in this show and it feels like only three ever get substantial attention. ;/ The other girls are all pretty one note and forgettable. They only ever show up for a little bit in the background, never really doing anything outside of their introduction. But the girls we actually get focus on can be pretty entertaining and are pretty likeable for what they are

Another thing about this anime that you will instantly notice is the animation quality. Its pretty okay to subpar in every episode, which I'm honestly not surprised by. I don't imagine an adaptation like this would get much funding sadly. ;c  Because of that, much of the animation can be jarring and come off as weirdly uncanny and creepy, like the dance in the OP. Other times the animation just feels kinda empty and utilitarian. Outside of the animation, the visual style is reminiscent of the manga's and sometimes does a surprisingly good job capturing the spirit of the original manga, but more often than not the art lacks that soft feel of line work and a general sense of cohesion the manga had that made it so initially appealing. A nice bit is that the colors in this anime are nice and vibrant which fits the vibe of this very non serious ecchi comedy show well!

As an anime who's main appeal to me and presumably most viewers is the big boobies and big tummy jiggling fan service nonsense, how does the ecchi hold up? It's pretty mediocre unfortunately. There are lotsa scenes of the girls bursting out of their clothes or through some contrived nonsense their shirts tear right at the boob which at a surface level would be sexy right? Supporting this is the full uncensored nudity in this anime, which is awesome, but the anime's more slice of lifey comedy tone doesn't make it feel all that sexy. The monster girls generally don't seem to care about being seen naked which is fine, but it ends up making the anime not feel particularly horny outside of the shallow fact that they are often naked. I don't mind the ecchi not being amazing since I did genuinely enjoy the SoL bits of this anime. That being said, it is nice having some chubby girl fan service for once, its a such a rare thing to see in anime and I'm elated this anime supplies. Its something I've been wishing for forever

Overall, Plus Sized Elf  is not worth a watch for the average viewer. But if you enjoy trashy ecchi, bigger girls, or both I think there is definite value here! This is not a complex anime, and the production quality is pretty poor, I wish it was better produced but I found myself enjoying it for what it was. Even outside of my surface level liking of chubby girls, the low stress, dumb fun comedy of this show was enjoyable enough for me to give at least a 5. That being said, my liking fat bitches absolutely made me enjoy this anime more so I'm giving it a 6 xD"

Even despite that though the show is pretty bad, animation is very low quality, the fan service is just random as hell and the story is mostly nonexistent. I'm happy the episodes were only 12 min long becauseI wouldn't have been able to get through a full length episode every week.

57845,537969.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Would heavily suggest reading the manga. The anime was a long time coming, for what it is it doesn't do the series justice. Animation: it gets really bad. It's on the nose with following the manga, a bit too on the nose with how stiff shots can get. Panels where you expect it to be animated a certain way are completely still. The characters are off model a lot. The inconsistencies are really jarring, especially on Dark Elf. She's supposed to be flat chested but her cup size is ever changing with each episode. I had mixed feelings on a few voices for the characters, especiallyfor Satyr. I was not expecting her voice to be that deep. Wished it was higher. Same with Dragon. The rest sound good.

The story is simple enough as this is mainly ecchi, but they messed up the order of the chapters with one episode.

I still watched this all the way through as a cope (lol) from waiting so long, got slight enjoyment from seeing these characters (rarely) come to life. Seeing this honestly made me feel bad for Synedoche, he already had to deal with switching publishers and his anime adaptation is mediocre, he can't catch a break."

The show is a pretty mixed bag in terms of comedy and probably the worst I've seen in regards to animation (obviously low budget with some of it being laughably bad). If you like chubby girls, you'll probably like this show. If not, there is a chance you'll still like it, but it'll more than likely be a pass. Regarding comedy, for every hit of a joke, there is a joke that misses or is just too predictable. Ithink there was one or two that made me laugh, and a few that had me smiling, but the rest were just alright. Honestly it was the animation and off-model visuals that had me laughing more than the intended comedy (occasional lazy eyed faces or questionable animations). But with all that said, as a Certified Chubby Chaser™ and just going into the show knowing full well what it would be, I had a generally good time. I kept teetering on giving a 6 or 7, but kept it at 7 in the end due to the later episodes being consistently enjoyable."

57845,539160.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"I really wanted to like this anime. I love the source material, as well as the characters. But this anime is what a lot of us in this scene expected: low-budget drivel that doesn't really do the source justice. I'm glad that it has an adaptation to begin with, but I'd be lying if I was totally satisfied. The animation is, let's face it: quite poor, but strangely enough, I feel it is at its worst in the OP and ED. The actual show is serviceable, despite wonky faces now and then. I will say that it is extremely faithful to the source, though. Whatyou see is what you get, but that in addition to its quality means that this adaptation really doesn't bring anything new to the table.

I've read the original manga (all 8+2 currently available in English!), and I follow the author's art. I recognize that the art is... well, let's say niche. My kind of niche, though, so I obviously enjoyed that part of it.

I'm here for that sweet sweet WG, that jiggle, those thighs and especially those tummies, big or just chubby. If you're also here for that, then just go watch it already. If you're not... well, I'll say that this is still extremely funny, but bad official subs do hold it back. If there are fansubs, I'm sure they're better, but in typical HIDIVE fashion, they've played them way, way too loose. My Japanese probably doesn't even qualify as ""beginner level"", but even I can tell these subs just aren't accurate. It's not 2005, guys! We know things about Japanese culture! You don't need to ""dumb it down"" for us! (ex. E11, uses ""valley girl"" instead of ""gyaru"")

56348,539231.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Dungeon no Naka no Hito is a surprisingly well-made anime about the logistical management of an artificially made dungeon. It's a slice-of-life sort of fantasy regarding the management of a dungeon. Does that interest you? You're in luck. It's a robust work that's quite varied and doesn't get boring. After all, there's a lot to cover. How does an artificial dungeon refill its chest, get rid of garbage, and design levels? Why is there a lot of magical power flowing through there, and how is there a seemingly infinite supply of monsters? Overall, there are a lot of things to talk about as we see Clay andBelle interact with each other. I'll also be damned if there's anime talking about the management of much more mundane things such as local shops and restaurants, then you can surely pull off a dungeon management type of anime as well. 

And, of course, characters certainly play a large role in anime. Clay and Belle are employer and employee, but as the two interact with each other, a blooming friendship also occurs. Clay's a typical adventurer, trying to discover the mystery of her father's whereabouts. Her goal seems to be to get strong enough to reach her father's level. On the other hand, Belle is a more relaxed dungeon master, but as a result of that, is lonely and reclusive as a result.  

Both Clay and Belle seem to have reached near the pinnacle of human ability, Clay being a world-class thief/rogue while Belle a world-class mage. Rather, it's their other departments they seem to be completely clueless about. Neither character has much social interaction due to their lifestyle, and despite their human nature to socialize, they never had the opportunity to or were too scared or anxious to deal with other people. Thus, the slice of life of managing a dungeon gives a good backdrop for character exploration, development, and understanding of characters better. Of course, the dungeon development in its own right is interesting, but the characters complete the story.

The way the story deals with more mature themes is also quite consistent. While Belle and Clay are both perhaps good-natured, they also don't shy away from death. After all, it is a fantasy anime about dungeon clearing. A dungeon by nature is a death-churning machine, and thus people will die. People will also reveal their ugly sides when faced with desperate situations. Punishment by death is sometimes necessary in a rule where the iron fist is the strongest, and both Clay and Belle are well aware of this.  Belle and Clay are not completely clueless and innocent to the world around them. They know the rules of the world and live by them too, and they don't think so pure-heartedly that they think discourse is the only way to solve a problem. Rather, they've more than fulfilled their physiological and safety needs through personal experience and strength, and the show more focuses on their social and self-actualization needs instead.

The show has a solid foundation of decent characters, and while I would like more side characters, it's good enough. The episodes flow seamlessly despite there not being a huge overarching plot, the anime still consistently produces good-quality episodes and I'm never bored of Clay learning more about the dungeon. I also quite immensely appreciate that no CGI was used for monsters. The animation quality is simple but effective."
56348,538589.0,6.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Dungeon People - Dungeons have gotten more complex over the years seen through anime, so let's take a step back to attend a masterclass on how dungeons operate, shall we? Let's be real for a hot moment: the world is getting more complex, things are getting tougher by the day, and entertainment is slowly seeping into our brains that are suffering from decreasing IQ each and every day. Sometimes all you need is just something that pulls us back to its roots and slows us down in the ever-growing pace of life that never slows down. Luckily, within the height of the rom-com genre for thehot and sour Summer season, if you need a show that just allows you to be a couch potato and just go figure, boy do I have the show for you: mangaka Sui Futami's Dungeon no Naka no Hito a.k.a Dungeon People, a slice-of-life fantasy adventure comedy about dungeons and what goes on in the deep troughs that is, its many layers of underground obfuscation. And if I didn't know any better, her earlier adaptation of the 5-minute short series Mahou Shoujo Nante Mou Ii desu kara. back in 2016 was an awkward and cringeworthy write-off.

A small family so fixated on wanting to conquer the dungeon, that's a good thing. But what's not is that when one of the family members goes missing in said dangerous place, someone has to go find that family member to reassure him or her that he or she is safe. This is the scenario for Clay, a young woman with the skills of a thief, whom she traverses the dungeon to find her missing father, who's been gone for 3 years. Clay is so capable in fact that her Thieves' Guild acknowledges her as one of its best adventurers, being able to reach the deeper depths of the dungeon alone. But once she gets there, she gets a rude awakening facing the usual monsters...in a rather unkempt environment that feels like a dungeon, yet it is not at the same time. In fact, the dungeon is led by the final boss...of a young girl, whom Clay coincidentally found out when she was facing a rather tough monster, that after the fact, she dismisses the monster like it was her fellow co-worker and takes Clay under her wing...to help manage the dungeon alongside her.

For starters, this rather uncanny dungeon doesn't even feel like a dungeon at all, but rather, resembles an upside down typical human office, but for monsters instead. The final boss of the dungeon, this cute lil' sweet girl of Belle, she's as easy as she comes, despite the fact that she actually exudes boss energy thanks to her outstanding abilities. And unlike the human bosses of ego and pride, she takes care of the monster population within her dungeon like an actual kind and thoughtful caretaker, discerning issues as they go. Of course, how would a human like Clay come to understand all of this, and that's where the abnormal relationship between the young'uns of the human and the final boss comes in to weigh on the overall situation. The job ranges from taking care of the monsters in various rooms, dungeon operations from design to ideation, heck, even planting your soul to monsters through gems to imitate being monsters with human capabilities. Anything goes in this dungeon management class that's a sight to behold, being a change of pace outside of the typical stuff that we're so used to seeing. It's actually infotainment value, I've gotta say, for the standard and the unusual.

Clay and Belle's relationship is so tight, you could almost call this a Yuri-esque CGDCT trait for the goofy comedy banter between both girls who act just as normal as they come, or even towards the point of disbelief (at least much for Belle) to play off as the funny woman who feigns ignorance at times and expecting Clay to get her meaning, but which often fails to decent hilarity. Alongside another fellow employee of the dungeon, Rangard is the undisputed dungeon's treasurer, taking care of things that range from monetary expenses through its many treasure chests, weapons manufacturing, and even on-site construction supervision of the monsters he's in control of. I just find the small rock golems that Rangard supervises, quite the adorable monotone monster that's actually quite versatile with its occupation of dungeon maintenance and handiwork, aside from just the typical small and weak monsters they are to face the usual group of adventurers invited to tackle Belle's ever-changing dungeon. One thing's for sure: don't expect the complex out of this rather simple dungeon, just take your time sinking things in at a slow, comfortable pace that honestly, doesn't take away the enjoyment out of a simple, almost generic show like this.

Neither its production nor its music will win it any awards, as OLM's animation is quite minimalistic, and the OST is just a simple, charming theme, aside from the upbeat OP and ED from TrySail and Akari Nanawo, respectively, which were mediocre to decent.

Overall, Dungeon no Naka no Hito a.k.a Dungeon People is actually a fine show that still has its own world-building, albeit at a snail's pace that some will like, and many others don't. Instead, what it delivers is a solid, steady pace of an enjoyable trip down the depths of the Earth just to have a good time to hang out with fellow monsters that treat you better than the humans do, that all along, was a strategic approach that does its small wonders to impress the ""chosen"" few.

If you're on the fence, just try and see if it does work for you."
56348,538653.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Dungeon no Naka no Hito follows the story of Clay, a thief who ventures into a mysterious dungeon in search of her lost father. Instead of the usual adventuring fare, she ends up taking a job working for the dungeon’s caretaker, Belle. The series attempts to offer a behind the scenes look at dungeon operations, coupled with an exploration of the relationship between Clay and Belle. While the concept is intriguing, the execution leaves much to be desired. The premise of diving into the inner workings of a dungeon is intriguing, but for a story to effectively delve into this subject matter, it needs strong worldbuilding and creativity, areas where this anime unfortunately struggles. The dungeon itself feels underdeveloped, and explanations for how things work come off as shallow and contrived. Basic questions that naturally arise from the premise often remain unanswered, and the lack of depth detracts from what could have been a rich setting. When compared to shows like Made in Abyss or Dungeon Meshi, which both offer intricate ecosystems, interlocking lore, and thoughtful design, the dungeon in Dungeon no Naka no Hito pales in comparison. In these other series, creatures, environments, and mythology all intertwine in meaningful ways, creating worlds that feel alive and vibrant.

Here, the mechanics feel arbitrary. The story seems content with hand waving away details, resulting in a world that feels half baked. The absence of clear reasoning or lore behind the dungeon’s function limits the viewer's engagement. Some might argue that this simplicity is intentional, that we shouldn’t take it too seriously, but even if that’s the case, it doesn't excuse poor world building. Whether something is bad on purpose or accidentally doesn’t change the fact that it’s still bad. There is potential humor in how the show tries to justify game like mechanics in a supposedly real world, but even this rarely lands in a satisfying way.

Belle, the dungeon master, presents an interesting contrast at first. Her cutesy, playful persona is juxtaposed with the ruthless nature of dungeon life, where adventurers risk their lives and face harsh consequences. This initial contrast works well in theory, as it could highlight the duality of her character, she may be lighthearted on the surface but is ultimately tied to the brutal reality of the dungeon’s nature.

However, this dynamic falls apart when Belle’s actions take an unexpected turn. In one particular episode, a group of adventurers exploits the dungeon’s dangerous environment to kill their teammates with plausible deniability. Given the established ruthlessness of dungeons and the fact that Belle herself seems to accept this brutality as part of the job, this scenario fits within the world’s logic. Even Clay acknowledges that dungeons are unforgiving, and up to this point, the show reinforces this idea.

Yet, despite everything leading up to this moment, Belle decides to intervene, saving a supposed ""victim"" and punishing the rule breakers. This act of moralizing feels completely out of sync with the show’s previous tone, as if the writers wanted to inject some sense of morality into a character and setting that had previously been indifferent to such concerns. What rules are being broken, and why does Belle suddenly care about them when she’s otherwise complicit in the dungeon’s ruthlessness? It’s a bizarre moment that undermines the show’s own internal logic and leaves Belle’s character feeling inconsistent. For a dungeon master who is supposed to be indifferent to the life and death nature of adventuring, her sudden role as a protector of some vague moral code is jarring and unearned.

What's more the second central theme of the show, the relationship between Clay and Belle, and while it has some charming moments, it ultimately falls flat. Their dynamic revolves around the loneliness both characters feel, now somewhat alleviated by their newfound companionship. There’s potential in exploring this friendship between two isolated individuals, but the show never delves into it beyond the surface level. While the cutesy interactions between the two can be entertaining, they don’t offer much depth. The friendship serves as a narrative device to keep the story moving, but it lacks the emotional complexity that could have made their bond compelling. Ultimately, their relationship feels like another missed opportunity for meaningful storytelling.

Dungeon no Naka no Hito had the potential to be a fascinating exploration of dungeon life and the bond between its central characters, but it squanders that potential with weak world building and inconsistent character writing. The show’s take on dungeon operations is underwhelming, lacking the depth and creativity that other series in the genre have mastered. Meanwhile, the relationship between Clay and Belle, though occasionally charming, doesn’t offer enough to elevate the series beyond mediocrity."

And, well, there wasn't one. The showgoes literally nowhere. Nothing happens. By episode 12 we are basically in the same spot we were in episode 2 or 3.

Don't get me wrong, there are still self-contained stories that are kinda interesting but they don't really impact the bigger picture at all. Clay starts off wanting to conquer the dungeon and find her father but each of those goals has 1 episode dedicated to it and, you guessed it, it goes nowhere. They keep setting things up and there is never any payoff, instead, it's all immediately swept under the cupboard.

I wish I could say I was looking forward to season 2 but there wasn't even a hook in the finale to give us something to speculate about, it just, kinda, ended... There is nothing that I'd be excited to see them explore in s2 because they have already shown that it doesn't matter and it will just be another crumb contained in a single episode and I don't see this series getting 10 seasons so it has enough times for these crumbs to add up to a satisfying conclusion."
56348,538767.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"This was a fun little show here. It's definitely the kind of show that you just kinda throw on and relax too, but doesn't really offer anything much beyond that. The concept is there for sure, but it doesn't really feel like any of the plot threads end up getting a fulfilling conclusion. It's recommended for fans of this kind of thing, due to its subdued yet leisurely tone and pacing. The animation was mostly solid, however there wasn't a ton about it impressive. The score was nice, and I did enjoy the majority of the designs of the various monsters, as well as thehumans. 

With the slice of life elements in the show it does make it feel a bit like nothing really happens. If you don't mind that sort of thing it really isn't bad, but it doesn't really help move the show along in a satisfying way. The best aspect of the show is between protagonist and the dungeon manager. The relationship works well because she is much more powerful than she looks, and our protagonist mostly the opposite. It makes for a fun dynamic watching the two of them fight others on occassion."

Tbh I jumped in with cozy elements in mind from recom by a friend but this has small quirks to make a nice rounded anime with logically elements of a working dungeon. It was best for me to give it a try after watching enough isakai for 6 years continously. I kinda gotten tired of some repetitive elements that many anime had (and yes I do ree-atch some trashy isakai out there) but this a breather and ane landscape would get better(I hope). There are action but not too many for my taste, but nonetheless a really comical and uniquetwist on dungeons as a concept.

Have fun watching!!!"
56348,538759.0,5.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"I went into this show thinking it might have the same energy as Delicious in Dungeon, so that might've made me more bias. But it was nothing like the other series other than taking place in a dungeon. This show does not have much of a plot at all. There is no end goal. It is just two cute girls managing a dungeon (like a hotel). Most of the plot is episodic so you can tune in at any time and not really miss any continuity plot points. It's a great watch if you have a lot of free time and want something mindless toend the day with. The plot is super simple and there is not a lot at stake.

The art is the same as the plot. Basic and a little boring. It uses light pastel colors for the palette for the most part. And that's where the interesting art direction ends. The animation and style are simple.... to tell a simple story. 

The characters are hard to remember. None of them had any character development other than the MC. The MC's development can be shortened into ""master adventurer turned manager."" There are no plots where they deal with internal conflicts or greater forces of external conflicts. At most it was different adventurers being a nuisance or monsters in the dungeon. 

I enjoyed it the first few episodes. As the plot went on, I realized it was the same thing over and over."

There's no romance, no drama, almost no fighting scenes, no big development or story to be told. To sum it up: this anime is boring. Characters: 7/10. They are awkward, and the lack of plots makes it hard to see any real development. Plot. 3/10. There's no plot, but sometimes the trivial elements of the MC's dailylife are interesting.

57099,538001.0,3.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Narenare: Cheer for You! - A cheerleading show that unfortunately, sows more discord than harmony. Hoo boy, where to start with the Anima Yell that could, but ultimately fizzled both in its sport and characterization? All I'm gonna tell you is that there's a reason why the ""Cute Girls Doing Cute Things"" a.k.a CGDCT genre has Doga Kobo being the best representative, and it's because the studio has experience adapting CGDCT series over the years that it has become synonymous with quality, as one would come to expect. On the other hand, there's P.A. Works, a studio that also has quality to back up, but mostof their anime, if considering just specifically the CGDCT genre, has quite the diverse range of works that aren't quite CGDCT-esque, but more towards the coming-of-age trend. And as much as the stellar studio has been one of the most consistent in recent years, sometimes they do hit a wall with new shows, as is the case of the 3 shows that they have showcased for this Summer 2024 season: the game-to-anime adaptation of Tensui no Sakuna-hime a.k.a Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin, the studio's signature original work of Mayonaka Punch from the director of Ya Boy! Kongming, and the worst offender of all: Na Nare Hana Nare, from Koudai Kakimoto, the current franchise director of BanG Dream!, thinking that he can replicate said series in a different skin through cheerleading.

A coming-of-age story that shows girls from all walks of life but with one thing connecting them: cheerleading. You have the typicals of Kanata Misora and Megumi Kaionji: childhood friends-cum-schoolmates who are connected by the sport they excel at, until a devastating accident almost broke the bond of the two, forcing one to go through therapy whilst the other having constant nightmares that she ""would not be able to fly again"". On the other hand, there's the unorthodox friend-couple of Anna Aveiro and Nodoka Ootani specializing in areas that are related to cheerleading, but that their interests just so happened to align with both Kanata and Megumi enough to join their bidding to wherever the cheerleading segment takes them to. And not to be outdone, the other girls that would complete the CGDCT gang, come from a rival school that boasts a well-oiled cheerleading team, and brings both Suzuha Obunai and Shion Tanizaki into the group that would go on to influence and inspire the group to do great things as they figure out what it means to cheer not just for people, but for their own selves as well.

Here's the big, and I mean, BIG problem for the anime: it just doesn't know what it wants to be. Try to get this: Like most athletes suffering from the yips, Kanata obviously was in total suffering after her best friend got injured from her grave mistake and is in a dilemma of her own after getting the boot from her cheerleading team. Enter Anna Aveiro, the Portuguese girl whose interest in the pursuit of trying to be a YouTuber, ropes both her friend Nodoka and the coincidental meet of Kanata and Megumi into producing content for her growing channel. From one moment to the next, Kanata is both getting dissed and inspired by the girl whose moves are like ninjas, Suzuha Obunai being a master at parkour with her petite figure to give the former a fighting spirit to come out of her rut. All of this sounds alright for the incoming premise to come...and then the infodump comes of a music shop on the verge of closing down, the typical school competition to create a sense of rivalry, and then the usual character-driven moments of conflicts gone wrong to the point of sacrificial love from one that is stubborn to listen and not work in concert with everyone else. Cheerleading is a team sport, but as much as the series sure likes to give them their individual moments to shine, for some unexplainable and plot-device reasons, it just doesn't come altogether, and more often than not, the girls, going by their cheerleading team name of PoMPoMs, end up executing not just the traditional cheerleading course of action, but doing things that don't quite define the sport to begin with.

As a result, the show feels disjointed trying to teach the audience about what defines cheerleading, as much as the girls who're just beginning to discover what it means to really do cheerleading and execute it to a degree that most people are already familiar with. To add insult to injury, the melodrama, which is its own Deus Ex Machina of asspull scenarios to get people to like PoMPoMs all the more amidst their own conflicts, can actually be easily resolved, if the writers ever care for them in the first place. If there's just one thing to take away, Doga Kobo's Fall 2018 show of adapting mangaka Tsukasa Unohana's CGDCT series of Anima Yell! does the entire genre so much justice, even its characters, which is just outright embarrassing when a nearly 6-year-old anime has so much potential than this show.

Look, I have no problems dealing with stereotypical character archetypes, but Na Nare Hana Hare just delivers unsatisfactory insanity to the point where you can separate fakery from the truth, and the acrobatic-heavy Kanata is at the epicentre of all the possible conflict caused by human selfishness, thinking that she has to shoulder the new group's responsibility all on her own. To the degree/extent, I admire Suzuha's character because of her impressive athletics alone, as well as the foreigner girl of Anna that puts family and her friends at the forefront that gels PoMPoMs together most of the time and is unafraid to call out when things are not doing well. As the close confidante, Megumi is trying her best to get through her therapy so that she doesn't need to worry Kanata as much, and both Nodoka and Shion are keeping tabs as fellow cheerleaders trying to get their heads together to actually do cheerleading together, for broke or for woke. If it weren't for Kanata, who shoulders the world on her own shoulders, PoMPoMs could've made a bigger wave than what they've been doing in the show, but it's the unnatural interaction and forced relationships that just have to be the straw that broke the camel's back, or in this case, the sturdy cheerleading pyramid.

This anime is P.A. Works going all-in to showcase a rather unkempt consistency that they're in for the new times of AniManga producing more in quantity than focusing on quality. Unfortunately, I have to say that this rather ""bold"" tactic of the studio just outright backfires so hard that I don't know what to say to salvage what's good about the show overall. Sure, it has the seal of quality that we've come to expect from P.A. Works, but bear in mind that decent quality-produced shows can even appear deceiving at face value, and this is where director Koudai Kakimoto and his team of scriptwriters of himself, Yuniko Ayana, and Midori Goto (who all hail from the BanG Dream! franchise as series composers and screenwriters) just falter in trying to deliver their version of an alternate BanG Dream! that just doesn't corroborate that well to begin with.

The OST is just there, and I'm not gonna lie if the music ever DID come through for the overblown scenarios and the like, because I did not feel one hinge where the music is used to good effect. More than anything else, rookie VA Rika Nagakawa is still in her growing phase after only having her debut as Momiji Ito in Summer 2022's Shine Post, and her second role as Kanata Misora is pleasing at the beginning, but it quickly grates on the ears that she still has a lot of work voicing on main roles. The unfortunate reality of voicing Kanata slowly pushed her character to the edge of hate, and it does not make for good impressions being hired for future shows to come. Also, while the ED is your typical VA-esque average character song, I have to say that I quite liked the catchy OP for its worth.

Regardless, Na Nare Hana Nare is the literate definition of ""jack of all trades, master of none."" The show itself is directionless, written like it needs characters of all sorts leaning to where the central group goes, and ultimately undermined by the shine and polish that is the studio recognition's name in trying to deliver a stellar product overall that is ""all style, no substance"".

P.A. Works, you've done yourself a big blunder from this show. This is NOT the way to do CGDCT shows, and you got the short end of the stick being chosen for this haphazard work."
57099,538066.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"**A forgettable story with a forgettable set of characters** Going by the description that it is a sports anime but with cheer dance, I expected it to be school-based. It defied my expectations. It's an after-school cheering club for girls from different schools. It's what is called an ensemble, but the problem with having too many characters is that you need to be with them for a long time to get to know them. Sometimes 26 episodes aren't enough, let alone 12. There is this character named Nodoka that I forgot who she is and what her role is, and if only she had her own characterarc, she would not have been a waste of character.

Anyway, it would have been better if this anime was based on one school competing against other schools. I know it's a more standard plot but it's better than the mess this anime was. 

The first several episodes were bad. They had to deal with Anna's shop closing, and it didn't feel like a cheer show until Ep 7 or 8. I forgot the episode where they cheered a certain school's baseball team. Then it was more tolerable, but at this point, many people would have dropped this.

Also, Kanata is annoying in her naivete. Mari's drama is forced so that by resolving that drama, they could end this purposeless slop.

It's great in a few places, but overall it's a turd."
57099,539115.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"While Na Nare Hana Nare may appeal to CGDCT fans, I don't think it's quite fair to reduce it to such. It focuses more on drama, characterization and ""healing"" (iyashikei). In fact, much more so than Sports — a label which it gets purely by convention. The theme of this show is less cheerleading itself and more 応援 (""ouen"", i.e. rooting for or supporting someone in a general sense). As a Brazilian viewer, my score and review for this anime come from obvious motivation. Anna-chan might genuinely be one of the most accurately portrayed Brazilian characters I have seen in anime so far. In fact, aquality of this anime is being mindful of how stereotypes can (should) be used only as stepping stone to further understand a person.

The characters are at the same derived from their archetype but also have elements of a mental universe which extends beyond it. For instance, Anna is the extroverted and out of place Brazilian girl who often fails to read the room and adhere to cultural manners. While this element is initially played for flavor and cuteness, it's later shown to have strongly influenced her past, especially when first moving to Japan. This aspect explains much of her personality and how that has lead her to nurture a deep passion for music, given that she was ""rescued"" by Y.J. — owner of the vinyl record store which, by circumstance, became a shelter for Anna, a home where she was able to feel welcomed. Similar deconstructions happen with other characters.

As encapsulated by the last episode, Na Nare Hana Nare has an interest in talking about fears, and how these fears become barriers for one's achievements. In order to answer these conflicts, characters need to develop trust in one another and form strong bonds that ought to enable them to keep pushing through their struggles. That being said, while its intentions are kind, it lacks in depth. The show is empathetic, yet fairly shallow.

It lacks a concrete main plot and some kind of lasting message. As mentioned with Anna, the anime does have the ability to be tactful and delicate in how it portrays culture, personality and psychological conflicts — yet, those conflicts are stake-less and ""solved"" within the spam of 1-2 episodes with the power of cheering.

On the matter of production, Na Nare Hana Nare also suffers. Its style features a poor combination of colored contour lines with a pastel color palette and simple scenarios, resulting in something that is, cryptically, vibrant yet watered down. There is also a more detrimental issue when CGI is used for most of the cheering scenes. This is combined with no camerawork whatsoever, which makes those scenes very bland, if not ugly. But I should leave a positive nod to the work behind the OP and ED, as they are very pleasant to watch, and the art throughout the show is mostly consistent.

As it is, the anime in general lacks originality and depth to persuade a spectator about anything regarding its theme which they wouldn't already be willing to agree with. I did not care about cheerleading before it (as a real life practice) and I've experienced no change in that stance afterwards. Ultimately, one who comes to the show with the proper expectations will be satisfied. I guess it's more accurate to say this show is ""comforting"" rather than ""healing"". At the end of the day, this is entertainment, and not meant to provoke thought. It succeeds in such with characters that are generally quite charismatic."
57099,538111.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"PA works had an insane summer season with 3 anime original series airing. Two of which being in my top 10 of the season. For me, Narenare was just slightly below Mayopan, but I still loved it. A cheerleading anime was novel for me. The girls were great, the plot lines were compelling and I learned a lot about competitive cheer. Despite PA works usual Yuri bait, I enjoyed the chemistry between the characters as well. There’s a powerful message of accepting friends with disabilities throughout the show that gave me a newfound appreciation for the studio. This was just a really good CDCT watchand I am certainly going to miss it.

For me the best part of this show was the bond between the pompoms girls. The cheering stuff was cool and all don’t get me wrong, but the girls coming together, forming a cheer group, overcoming their obstacles and past trauma and moving forward as a unit was awesome. All of the girls got adequately fleshed out and there were so many emotional moments that got me on the verge of tears. I had no idea how difficult competitive cheer could be or all the mental hurdles that went into preparing for a cheer competition, “flying” etc., until this show and now I have a profound respect for people that do this at a competitive level. It’s something you have to prepare your body AND mind for and if either isn’t in perfect sync it could be disastrous. There’s several points where characters are going thru mental issues and just can’t give their all to cheering, I liked how their arcs were developed and ultimately resolved. Each girl has a “ship pair” as I like to call them, basically a best friend within POMPOMS that they’re clearly gay for but PA works won’t let it develop.. all of them felt so intimate and tender, it’s a shame they didn’t  go to the next level though.

Arguably the second most important part of this show is Anna. Probably the most accurate representation of a Brazilian in anime history, Anna stole every scene and honestly felt like more of the MC than the actual MC of the series. She’s the voice of reason, hilarious, beautiful, you name it the girl was phenomenal and just has a presence that takes up the whole screen. I know it seems a little weird naming a character as the second best part of a whole series, but she truly was that great and anyone who has watched will appreciate it.

To further my point on disabilities, there’s a character in the show who had a disability. The rest of the cast NEVER isolate her or make her feel like a burden. In fact, they go out of their way to include her in every activity just like she can walk on her own. It might seem like a minor thing to some, but for me this sort of humanity from an anime cast has to be applauded, especially because this character is in the show so much

I’m a big fan of the colour palette and unique art direction they went with for this show. It’s so bright and cheery and I think it matches the vibe of the story well. The animation is solid, the cheer sequences often incorporated CGI, but given the complexity of them, I can’t really fault that. I will say that when we actually had cheer meets, they looked really good. One of the few complaints I’d have with the series in addition to the Yuri bait would be that there weren’t many cheer comps. You had the requests that the group would take on, but not a lot of trials or comps.

If you’re a fan of cute girls doing cute things and want it in a new environment(cheer), like Yuri vibes or PA works originals in general this is an easy recommend. It’s not perfect, but I really loved this show. The characters, the interpersonal drama, the girls growing as individuals over the course of the show etc. it’ll be missed 

Narenare gets 8 out of 10."
57099,538644.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"On paper, this anime seems to have a promising setup, a former national star cheerleader trying to regain her confidence after a life-altering event, surrounded by new friends with their own diverse talents. However, what the show delivers is a scattered narrative that never quite finds its footing. The primary issue stems from the show's structure. While it's common in ensemble cast shows to focus on individual characters in episodic arcs, the anime fumbles this approach. Instead of weaving these individual stories into a cohesive narrative, the show feels disjointed. After the girls initially come together to form a cheer squad, the show loses sight ofits central premise. The cheer leading element, which should anchor the characters and their development, is pushed to the background, becoming more of a loose excuse to move from one character's backstory to the next. Without a strong through line tying these episodes together, the story lacks momentum.

This scattershot approach is compounded by the bloated cast. Each character is introduced with unique talents and aspirations, but none of them are given the depth they deserve. As the show jumps from one character arc to another, it struggles to fully develop any of them. This lack of balance means the series never settles into a clear rhythm or focus, leaving it to aimlessly drift through its runtime. What could have been a compelling exploration of individual and collective growth is undermined by the show's inability to decide what story it actually wants to tell.

Kanata Misora and Megumi Kaionji, the two central characters, are perhaps the biggest victims of this mismanagement. Their initial conflict, rooted in Megumi's physical recovery and Kanata's initial pursuit of cheer leading success could have been a powerful emotional thread. Yet instead of deepening this core relationship, the show introduces a senpai with a nearly identical arc, diluting the tension and making their resolution feel rushed and unsatisfying. This redundancy is emblematic of the show's broader inability to capitalize on its own narrative potential.

In the end, this anime squanders its premise by failing to commit to a clear direction. What could have been a nuanced exploration of friendship, recovery, and cheer leading is instead a series of disjointed character vignettes. The cast is there, the setup is there, but the show never finds the heart needed to bring it all together."
57099,538023.0,4.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"When the Summer Season was announced, two Anime Originals were announced for PA Works, Na Nare and Mayonaka Punch. I initially thought, that given that this show is largely made by a lot of the same people behind MyGo, I had assumed that this show would be the better of the two with a focus on character drama. Oh how wrong I was. While ostensibly about using cheerleading to bring cheer to others, the show actually has very little cheerleading in it. In fact, most of my gripes with the show is how it seemingly doesn't know what it is about. Several plot points and charactertraits are brought about, but virtually none of them have been followed through or received any meaningful development of the sort. Things are bad when the main antagonist is abruptly introduced in the second last episode, promptly goes through a redemption arc, then goes missing and the show expects the audience to sympathize with her? I mean, huh? Throughout the whole ordeal I was questioning who this character was when everyone was treating her as if she had been part of the main cast since the start. (she had very minor appearances and maybe 2 spoken lines up to that point too). 

It's apparent that the character Mari (ie the no name last minute antagonist) and Megu were likely initially conceived as the same character, but, either because someone in the team or higher up didn't want to have a crippled wheelchair user as the main antagonist, decided to drop her and what we're left is an absolute mess of a plot.

Not to say that the other episodes were any better. With the exception of the Ouendan episode, every other episode is either pointless or boring. Again, for a character-driven show that is mainly drama focused, it is not a good look to establish some personality traits for a character only to not follow up on how that affects the character at all. Take a look at Megu for instance, she's crippled and Kanata blames herself for it. That's interesting. What's disappointing is that, despite the novelty of having a crippled cheerleader whose backstory is pivotal to the formation of the group in the first place, she does almost nothing and fades out into the background. Apart from one really cringe worthy scene that I'm trying my hardest to forget.

If anything, everything I had wanted from Na Nare, I got it from Mayonaka Punch instead. Everything from character drama to plot structure to even the idea of having a last minute antagonist join the protagonist group, all of these were executed incredibly well in Mayonaka Punch. Even the very idea of setting up a Youtube channel and getting flamed online is only done well in one show. Na Nare even fails at being a Gunma shilling show. 

As Kanata would have said, cheer is like cabbage. It's course and rough, and it gets everywhere.

57099,538197.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I'm not going to lie to you, I came into this anime out of curiosity to see how a girl in a wheelchair would participate in a cheerleading club. Fortunately, I stayed because of the interesting topics that these girls bothered to expose. I'm not a regular in the CGDCT genre, I think this was my first experience. I thought that throughout 12 weeks, I would only see happy girls trying to make more people happy. I couldn't be more wrong, because even though the girls were children, they never tried to infantilize their problems. Post-traumatic stress, yips, spiral of self-destruction, the search for personal dreams,the sense of belonging and frustration. Each of the girls has her own problem that they will explore thanks to the formation of the PomPoms group. A group founded to cheer others, but its main function would be to cheer the girls that make up the group. Each of them had their own personal conflict that was explored and even gave them time to explore the problems of girls outside the group.

Topics as delicate and complex as depression, self-destructive spiral, self-loathing, hate comments on the internet and the consequences of these on real people. The pressure of the work that involves creating content on social networks and the physical and mental ravages that this type of excessive work causes in people. In the end, cheerleading was only a theme to attract people's interest so that when you were on the networks of the story, you could let go of other more serious topics.

The anime also has respect when it shows a half-Brazilian character. Even though they represent Latin blood in a stereotypical way, it doesn't become offensive or a simple mockery. They really take it seriously, they give you a character who is multilingual and also you can see the difference between the hot blood of the Latinos and the mediating style of the Japanese. The contrast is so noticeable but at the same time it works very well because of the type of environment where it takes place.

Although I liked the story, we must say that the story lacked a bit of what it promised, cheerleading. Sometimes they focused so much on personal stories that cheerleading was left aside. There is choreography and acrobatics but not as much as one would like. Sometimes in the more relaxed chapters a bit more choreography would be appreciated, beyond just girls screaming at the top of their lungs.

It was a pleasant surprise for me to see this anime. I underestimated what the genre could bring and they showed me that sometimes the stigmas that one carries regarding certain things can be broken at any moment. I think it is an anime that opened the door to a new world of stories and characters. I certainly thank Nanare for opening my eyes."
57099,538580.0,3.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Possibly the worst PA Works has produced so far? Excusing the story being about nothing and going nowhere, as there is another review that talked about it much better than I could, I think what is unexcusable is that the cast wasn't devoid of radiance, but could not shine at all in how the show was executed, and they had no chemistry. There are countless scenes where they're just hanging out, doing homework and eating yokan, but it never sells the friendship, their conversations are mostly plot progression, exposition or a gag that develops nothing. What brings them together and keeps them together isn't tangible, ithonestly feels like they're together because the plot demands them to be, then when the drama requires them to split apart, it doesn't make you feel anything. Their entire ""bond"" is being told, not shown, so the most essential part of a show like this is absent. The two-parter format could possibly be to blame, an issue is presented just to be solved in the next episode, so there is no weight or meaning to anything that happens (but then again, Boukyaku Battery has a two-parter about overcoming yips that outdoes everything NareNare did in 12 episodes, so it's probably the writing that is at falut, not the execution). An issue that wasn't there appears, and then is gone. If the show was good, I think episode 8-9 and 12 could have been good, as there was an emotional core there, but they delivered payoffs that weren't setup, so all of it fell flat.

These characters had in common the fact they had underlying issues they struggled with, yips, rehab to walk again, being a foreigner and having anger issues, being autistic, being shy/anxious and... being bad at singing? Shion's role in this show is a mystery to me, I'm sorry. From the character concepts, it seems like it was supposed to be more psychological than how it ended up being, with stupid shallow plots being solved like nothing, instead of problems passing through each of the characters' mental issues and coming out with different answers and approaches towards its solution. Instead of there being anything personal to any of them, the answer to everything is ""cheering"", which makes the show stale and furthers the lack of meaning to any and every drama presented. Instead of being treated as sports often are in sports anime, cheering is a Deus ex Machina to not have to engage seriously with the very drama the series creates; the series raison d'etre is what kills it, making one wonder if the cheering was added afterwards to answer the questions presented, or if cheering was the only thing conceptualized and they winged everything else, resulting in this flavorless mess."
57099,538255.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Narenare takes the structure of idol or music band anime, replace the theme with cheerleading, and does one different thing: the girl group formed with no grand goal in mind, they just wanna cheer. This key difference may make the anime feel all over the place as it lacks a general direction. The group leader, Anna, would casually say things like getting rich or famous, but she never cared about those stuffs. The lack of promise, the lack of a clear destination, would frustrate the viewers, but it also makes their progress unpredictable and open to wider options. Most importantly, this approach is in linewith the characters' motivation and personalities. Rather than the competitive, do-or-die, sports-like mindset, the girls in this anime are just happy-go-lucky teenage girls who decided to cheer outside school just because. So whether you would like this anime or not could depend on if you can tolerate the mindless youth vibe these cute girls are going for. 

Do mind that, this anime is a teenage drama first, whatever second. These girls may not wanna be top idol or perform live on Budoukan, but they still mean business, they often get into intense dialogues and sometimes get a little bitchy. Well, there are only like 3 girls being bitchy, Anna being the boss bitch most of the time. So, thanks, Anna, for spicing up the drama. The most impressive qualities of Narenare is that its drama rarely feels forced or cringey. The characters' struggle are always laid with reasonable setup, their emotions have a steady buildup, and their responding solution is going back to their theme, cheerleading. Ahh, the classic. The dialogue or scriptwriting has a masterful flow too. In a few instances, there are conversations about cheerleading that smoothly transition to characters expressing their emotions, vice versa. The emotional moments also never overstays its welcome, its duration always matches the weight of the buildup. I usually dislike teenage dramas for how excessively sobby they get, however, Narenare consistently hits the right balance for me. 

Spoiler alert, I guess. Unfortunately, the anime concluded with little to no potential of season 2. I am still shocked. I thought the pacing flowed perfectly, and they would run another season to further develop the girls' chemistry. But story ended abruptly with a reason set up since the first episode. In hindsight, it does feel like a Ending B prepared in case the anime doesn't get the green light for Season 2. It's a nice Ending B, but I am devastated. I love the outlandish and hilarious voice acting of Anna, Kanata and Lala. I love the artstyle choice of using coloured outlines. I love the contrast of sadness and happiness this anime shifts around. There are so many good things going for Narenare, it hurts a little to see their journey end so soon."

This is more than CGDCT, this is more than just cheerleaders, this is about real human emotions. That we all as people have had to go through in life to get to that next point in our lives. Through the slow burn that this anime helps build up, you see that no matter how you are in life with success. Success can last for minutes, days, hours, or years. It is how you use itto make people's lives and yours as well.

Cheer For You could have easily been a 24 episode anime series, and to get to point A to point B with its pacing where nothing felt rushed. We get to see the trials and struggles of the main characters as well. For me if this anime is not something you can't see the past of character development, and real conflict. Then you are absolutely missing out on an underrated anime."

That being said, as an anime, it struggles with stuffing too much in one season. Na Nare Hana Nare's animation, music and upbeat nature is a treat. The girls look fine, the cheer choreography is great. Every character feels like they are their own entity and have relevance to the world. The only problem with this show, is because the characters are actually realistic, they all have problems that are entangled and the showrespected that enough to attempt to address all of them usually at the same time. It really did its best but the effort stumbled a lot as clearly by the final episode, a lot of new problems were poorly introduced but it was at least adequately solved. 

If this show had 2 seasons, this would have been great, but with the 1 season we get, it is a well thought out jumble of a show, that I liked but I know could have been done much better with a few more episodes."

But even if you're new to Mononoke (not to be confused with Princess Mononoke), this movie will be a real trip. Beautiful visuals, amazing soundtrack and cast, interesting plot and characters. You'll find yourself sucked into a world of colour and emotion. Traditional Japanese elements mix with the supernatural and the occult, composing a feast for the eyes and senses. Mononoke Karakasa, just like the TV series Mononoke, travels back in time to the Edo period to follow the steps of the mysterious figure of the Medicine Seller, who is here to fightthe ""mononoke"", the malevolent spirit that appears and feeds off the feelings and actions of the characters in the story. Karakasa takes place in the Ōoku of Edo Castle, the women's quarters, where the mononoke starts getting stronger thanks to the women's grudges and resentment at having to sacrifice what was important to them in order to perform their duties. To be able to slay the mononoke, the Medicine Seller has to first figure out its Form, Truth and Reason.

Strong female presence, friendship, character development and a stronger mononoke than we've seen before that leads to an epic fighting scene, set this movie apart from the original TV series. It is worth a watch or maybe even a rewatch to be able to take in all the elements and symbolism of the story."
52107,533996.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"It’s been years since I’ve watched a movie so meticulously curated, one that left me amazed at every moment. Everything about it was perfect—from the voice acting to the psychological depth of the characters, from the camera work to the aesthetic choices, the direction, and the music (Taku Iwasaki was the composer—like, HELLO?). You name it. You can expect the same exceptional experience delivered in the original TV show, but now in movie format, with 2024 techniques and a solid story filled with intriguing developments and breathtaking visuals. I’m still blown away by the backgrounds. It felt like floating in a museum. Every moment of the moviewas like being immersed in a damn museum. And don’t even get me started on the hinted queerness—add +100 points for that!

The Kusuriuri voice actor was Hiroshi Kamiya (Araragi from Monogatari Series, Levi from Attack on Titan...), and I’m pretty sure they also cast Yuki Kaji (Eren from Attack on Titan).

For fans of the TV show, you’ll also catch a few references back to it! (At least that’s how I interpreted certain narrative and visual elements.)

If you have any questions, shoot! But seriously, get ready for this movie—it’s going to be worth all the hype."
57567,538108.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Simply put, if you at all liked Shy season 1, you’re going to love this season. Season 2 is an improvement in essentially every way over season 1. It’s got a better story, more action and we see Teru fully come into her own as a hero. The Shinobi arc was the highlight of the season and while it started a little slow, when it really got going it was so good. Cliffhanger after cliffhanger and just being left on the edge of your seat wanting more Shy! By now you really know if you’re going to like Shy or not. This season is moreof the same in terms of Teru being adorable and dealing with her social anxiety, saving the day here and there and balancing her responsibilities as a hero with her duty as a student. This series is refreshing to me because I prefer female MCs who I find are often written better than their male counterparts. I think a lot of people can empathise with Teru’s struggles in the same vein that people relate to Peter Parker balancing school, a job and girlfriend with being spider-man. 

Shy season 2 does everything season 1 did better+expands on the world substantially including introducing new characters and concepts(shinobi) and fleshing out the villain’s goals and plans. One of the main complaints of season 1, which was the lack of action for a hero battle shonen is also addressed. There’s a lot of fights in this season, but they’re not just mindless battles for the sake of it. I like how the author uses fights for the characters to convey their feelings. There’s a lot of thought that goes into the action in this if that makes sense. Shy’s ability isn’t really about just beating people up, it’s about being a light in the darkness for those who feel alone and hopeless and the way the big set pieces play out this season reflect that.

Really just had a lot of fun with this season. I know it doesn’t have the highest score or hype which is a shame because it is truly one of the best ongoing shonen in my opinion and one of the best MCs. 

Shy season 2 gets 9 out of 10."
57567,538198.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"The heroism speech presented in Shy is definitely one of my favorites. Shy's idea is that heroes are not law enforcers, they are not there to punish but to protect. It doesn't matter if you are a civilian, a hero or a villain, everyone has the right to be saved because it is easy to judge but we don't know the reasons why someone becomes a villain. The story shows you all the information you need to understand, comprehend and empathize with the characters, but it is always consistent with the message of never judging others, since we are not in a position to do so.The image of the hero, that existence that shines so brightly as to eradicate the darkness of hearts, is what he wants to establish throughout this season.

One of the positive aspects is that every detail counts. Everything that is told to you throughout the 12 chapters will have an impact on the climax of the story. Whether it's a little anecdote, a technique for skipping rocks in a lake, or information about the town of one of the new characters, everything will be relevant towards the end of the conflict. Shy is not a perfect heroine nor the strongest, but she is certainly the one who tries the hardest. That's why people feel comfortable with her, because SHY will never abandon you, even less if you're suffering.

The pace of the story is the most questionable, the first half can feel a bit heavier because it feels like nothing happens. The characters have a lot of dialogue that seems as if the chapter goes by slower than it should. Although this is made up for in the second half, where everything explained in the first part takes on more importance. Even so, it means that you have to watch 6 chapters of something that feels like it's going nowhere. Shy is an anime that needs patience and understanding to meditate a bit on the message. If you're looking for typical superhero action, you might be disappointed, as it's probably not going to deliver what you're looking for.

The bad guys aren't that bad, nor are the good guys that good. In the end, it's all about each person always being aware that they have to keep trying to reach the ideal version of themselves. Shy leaves me with many lessons that need to be meditated on and assimilated in order to try to bring the heroism of the screen into real life."
57567,538107.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Shy: Tokyo Recapture Arc - Has Japan's hero gone ever more soft, or has she finally risen to the table to reclaim her Hero title? When mangaka Bukimi Miki's HeroAca alter-ego of Shy dropped last Fall, many people didn't really believe that it has the foundational success to be able to become a small-sized chunk effort in the Shonen space, and the anime just left the masses divided on how to see an MC that was so far out of left field being the unique Hero that isn't the likes of most male MCs. At least in my view, I too felt the same that whileSeason 1 was a good introduction into getting to know the series in its roots, but its staying power wasn't as much realized as it could be, even after knowing the threat that's to come with the evil children group of Amamririku against the global heroes. So, come Season 2 with the Tokyo Recapture arc just half a year later, and does it help to establish Teru ""Shy"" Momijiyama further as Japan's Hero to stand on her own two feet? It's a bit of a complicated feeling, at least it was for me.

With Season 2 continuing the adaptation towards the Tokyo Recapture arc from Volumes 5 to the middle of Volume 9 of the manga, Teru and the heroes may have struck black gold getting to know Amamaririku and its hard-headed leader of Stigma better, but this is only the warm-up for what's about to come, as the evil children's group have big plans to turn the world to their side, starting with Teru's home in Japan. And this time, they're not kidding around. The basis for all this: the story of a sisterly bond that got awry to the point of love and hate, which is similar to Pepesha and her mother Tzevta back in Season 1.

Hailing from the Soga Village, it houses the central characters of the arc: the Tennoji sisters of Ai and Mai. The twin sisters, more so being of Shinobi descent, lived a rather fine life growing up with their family that raised them, with not a single care for the world outside them. However, Ai was the one who wanted to change things up as the tendency for the rule-strict village is beginning to grate on her nerves, and Mai just hecks the care out of everything to deal a rampage to the entire village, killing scores and ultimately leaving her own twin sister with a weak heart constitution that almost left her dead. It's with this sequence of events that bring both twin sisters to Japan, where Ai's Heart Blade Purity sword accompanies her, being her tool to speak of the issues of the heart that tells her to seek out Teru and alarm her of the heinous plan that's to come, led by her very own pessimistic and nihilistic sister, whom, like Tzevta, has succumbed to the plans of Amamaririku to wreck the lives of the innocent ever more.

If there's ever anything to note of going into Season 2, Teru is still the Shy moniker that she is, and there's just no better way than to push her buttons going into danger, with increasing life and death stakes that she could not afford to just leave it on the wayside. No, not after what she witnessed with Pepesha and Tzevta, that serves as the start of her training arc to be a proficient leader and hero when it comes to protecting her own homeland, which is now the subject of litigation from the same children's enemy group itself. But it's with the Tokyo Recapture arc that Teru finally has her guns blazing to improve her skills and legitimately act as Japan's Hero, showcasing the same that she's ever been since the premiere season, and improving on what she lacks, not just for the proper recognition as a certified hero but to prove to herself that she has got what it takes to face off against a fear-mongering group of kids who have life locked up for them. And for that, I can finally say that I'm proud of how Teru has come this far, even if she's still a constant work in progress. Ai Tennoji, however, is the star of Season 2, and her personality is pretty much the same as Teru, only more grounded to give the signifiance of her character, since she's facing her own twin sister serving as the season's arch-nemesis.

I don't know what it is, but it looks like 8bit has kind of admitted that Shy hasn't been their best foot forward, working at almost the same standard as Season 1 with their B-team. Certainly, the production values aren't impressive, but for what it is, it's not too bad enough to dismiss low expectations, tampered as it can be with the exact same quality from the prior season. Even the OST took a hit with the new OP/ED theme songs, and I find Season 2's offerings quite forgettable when compared to Season 1.

If there's a silver lining for Shy's sequel season, it's that Teru has immensely improved since the last time, and characterization is just as important for a series like this. However, when all is said and done, in the realm of superhero shows, Shy isn't quite the notable series that I was hoping for to stand out within similar contemporaries of the Shonen genre, and as a result, it's just too much of a complicated feeling for me to decide if the show was ever good to begin with.

If you need an alternative to series like My Hero Academia, Shy is a decent series that you can consider on your watch list. While it won't blow you away, there's some good in the bad, and it delivers when it needs to execute with ease. It's just not for me, and believe me, I've tried for both seasons, but the Heart Blade: Resonation just didn't pan out the way it wanted me to feel.

Regardless, the sequel is an improvement over the premiere season, and it's actually worth the watch if you feel the need to binge-watch the series in its entirety."

Or at least will bee soon, hopefully. I will be short and simple on this review and also i won't give you any spoilers. The quality is still top notch, the manga style was adapted with the same perfection as the previous seasons/parts with the mix between 2D for flashbacks and ""dreams"" mixed with 3D for most of the time, pretty much everything is 3D as you should expected and be used to by this point. And that's something ineed to point out, the 3D never fails to please the eyes, animation is smooth and you can quite literally feel the impact of the strikes. Masterpiece.

56704,534688.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I was really excited for this cour of episodes and it looks like at least a couple of the fights were worthy of that excitement and then some. Kuroki Gensai, in particular, is just a pleasure to watch anytime he's on screen, but when he's really challenged as he most definitely is this time around, you really get the opportunity to see him produce his A-game and it shines. Some of the animations in the last couple of fights in particular were truly top tier, using the CGI in a way that capitalized on some amazing panel layouts from the manga in glorious fashion. Thereare some aspects of this cour that hold it back, particularly the stretches of exposition. They're not helped by the fact that Kengan Ashura leaves a lot of dangling plot threads behind when it ends, providing some insights into various events that happened long before the series without delving into the numerous gaps in the story that Kengan Omega will eventually work to fill. And, though it hasn't happened yet, Kengan Omega also undercuts some aspects of the ending, which makes it harder for me to appreciate them (I won't spoil which ones). 

Still, it's hard to argue that aspects of the ending hit hard, and I liked how the animation really made those moments pop. Personally, my favorite portion of the Kengan Ashura series and a great lead-in to later events from Kengan Omega that will hopefully be adapted as well."
56704,537371.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"BIG MEN DOING MAN SHIT - 2 MAN 2 SHIT is back with the second meatiest tournament arc in all of anime after the one it copied its homework from. With lots of muscles, martial arts, drama, muscles, plot twists, hot women, hotter men, wrestling, muscles, blind cyborg black dudes, muscles, political strife, intense back stories and of course muscles, Kengan Ashura is here to once again deliver on what it does best and deliver on its grand climax! If you watched Kengan season 1 and liked it, this is really more of the same but even better! The matches are even better this time round,though there are some minor duds there too. Overall though, these are the strongest matches yet and the characters are now filtered down to the actually important ones, so there is much higher stakes and tension too. Compared to it's pappy Baki, Kengan has significantly less random bullshit and is easier to follow. It's also a more straightforward martial arts celebration, so if that's your think, this is a must watch. 

The animation remains top notch too and manages to capture this unbridled masculine intensity in all of its glory. While some dumb puritans out there may wince at the mention of CGI in anime, but here it's very much a stylistic choice and one that works towards the benefit of making all the attacks fluid, impactful and clearly readable and allows the fighters to wallop each other over and over and over and over again without each swing tanking the show's budget. The soundtrack hits just as hard too. I am just confused by two things - why did the opening change genres every 10 seconds? I love death metal polka latino ska J-rock as much as the next guy, but it's an odd choice. The ending song hits hard too, but why did they have to get Dr. Doofenshmirtz to perform it? Baffling.

For this second half, I wanna say this is definitely the peak of Kengan Ashura thus far. It contains easily the best fights thus far and is also where the story really picks up. A lot of lore is revealed and context is given to the bigger picture here. Regardless of that, all the final fights are given enough time to happen and the intensity in the ring never drops. This half of the season felt very dense with things to cover, yet it never felt rushed and all of it was paced wonderfully. It all lead to a lot of surprises and a very satisfying conclusion. Hope they don't make it all weird in Kengan Omega with some random malarkey or something (Hanafusa!).

Overall, a rock solid anime full of manly fights that are sure to keep the blood pumping. Like classic martial arts films, Kengan Ashura has a simple premise executed marvelously. You know what you're here for and you'll get it in spades!"
56704,538050.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Men exuding testosterone fighting, just what was needed. Kengan Ashura is a work to enjoy, to give yourself over to the immersion and enjoy the fights to the death between muscular men. Something that has to be recognized to the studio is that it managed to teach how to make an anime entirely based on CGI. It is customary for an anime made of CGI to be bad and with heavy, abrupt and clumsy movements. Larx Entertainment knew how to exploit the benefits of CGI and gave us quite fluid fights, with movements loaded with strength and power. You are always looking forward to the fightsto see how different fighting styles confront each other while supporting your favorite. In the tournament section it has everything you can ask for. Interesting fights, charismatic fighters, twists and a winner who is not the one the viewer wants but is the one the story needs.

The problem with Kengan lies when it wants to tell you a story about a character. It feels so unnecessary because you are simply lengthening the important fights. Many flashbacks that don't alter the story, they are just there to add background, but they are not good enough to capture the interest of the viewer. The fights, the action and the frenzy are so well done, that when they want to calm the mood, one doesn't want to stop, one wants to continue in the adrenaline rush of the fights. The constant interruptions to the frenetic atmosphere make you end up feeling every minute where there are no people fighting.

The ending seemed very good to me and as long as Omega doesn't get animated, I feel that it can fall on the good side of the industry's endings. In the end, the tournament was concluded satisfactorily. It is appreciated that they didn't opt ​​for the clichés of the tournament genre such as ""The final is interrupted by a 3rd force"" or that ""the protagonist has to withdraw due to an event that came out of nowhere."" Thank you Kengan for giving us a single winner and thank you for making it credible."

The non-cgi animations looked terrible as well, which is weird because they looked totally fine in the Baki crossover.

58357,538746.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin - Man, I wish I'd experienced the game before coming into this anime, because it has done the COMPLETE opposite for me to WANT to play the game now. If you'd ask me on how anime adaptations from games have fared for the last few years or so, I will tell you pretty much that's it's better to play the original games that inspired making anime out of it, because the adaptations were more or less hits and misses so much that there's no incentive to ever want to experience the games for themselves. Like the masses, I have quite thehistory when it comes to watching anime adaptations that never lived up the hype of the games themselves, but the fair few that did were CyGames's offerings of Uma Musume: Pretty Derby, and especially Princess Connect! Re:Dive of which its initial Spring 2020 season (that was right around the COVID-19 pandemic) impressed me so much to experience the mobage, I'm glad I eventually did after that...before Crunchyroll would shut down the service in April 2023 (for the global market), which I'm still salty at.

But not to worry, because this Summer 2024 season has brought us yet another joy of an unexpected adaptation: Tensui no Sakuna-hime a.k.a Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin, developed by Edelweiss and published by Marvelous (XSeed Games in North America) in November 2020, got its anime produced by P.A. Works, that's directed by Masayuki Yoshihara, the director for the Uchouten Kazoku a.k.a The Eccentric Family series, and written by the maestro that is series composer Jukki Hanada (which you ARE guaranteed to get a quality anime with his name attached) that any anime he does, is an instant watch.

Adapted from the game of the same name, Tensui no Sakuna-hime is a 2.5D side-scrolling, hack-and-slash farming simulator that's all about the rice-harvesting, supported by a cast that is as unique as they come, and scenarios that reflect the many elements that culminate in what is a very faithful adaptation towards the game itself. The plot about the spoiled brat that is Princess Sakuna being served her due when a group of humans tried to infiltrate their way into the Lofty Realm where the gods reside, only for the harvest goddess to stumble her way to keep the humans off-limits from a sacred place to invoke chaos around its passageway, leading to the head goddess of Lady Kamuhitsuki thereby banishing her alongside her dragon familiar Tama and the same group of humans to an island that's filled with demons as a temporary substitute to call home, until arrangements are made to be able to send them back to their world.

For starters, the anime adaptation is such a feels trip of a ride, adapting the same tranquil and cozy atmospheric vibe of the game, from its initial worries of Sakuna and the band of humans that she's in charge of and taking care of them despite her hard-headedness, to the rice-farming segment that just exudes all the joy and warm-hearted feelings, that you can't help but be transported into its world that's so inviting and experiencing the vibes of such a simple, but hearty plot/story to go by. Those who've already played the game know these feelings all too well, but it's the anime-onlies (like me) getting introduced into Sakuna's world that naturally sucks you in hard, and it's even damn near impossible to get out of. It's definitely a guilt-trip, especially if you're the emotionally deep-end kind of person like I am.

The colourful cast of characters in the game are many, but the main theme is centred around the series' titular MC herself. As I've already mentioned, Princess Sakuna herself is a lazy couch potato who just wants the others (like her fellow friend and Princess Kokorowa) to treat her as such, but it's really through VA Naomi Oozora that the true extent of her character is revealed to be like so, and the same VA that voices Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! a.k.a Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!'s main central female MC of Hana Uzaki, is, dare I say, a perfect fit for Sakuna's character who likes the extravagant and doesn't like to deal with the hard work, and she'll make you pay for it with her insisting annoyance. With the anime being a character-driven story at the same time, there may be no one leader in the band of humans, but Tauemon, Myrthe, Kinta, Yui and Kaimaru, accompanied by the island's only protector of otter Ashigumo and the enemy of their band that is Ishimaru, every character gets their moment to shine through the open-endedness of the medium, which is one of the strongest suits of the show that is paid very close attention to fleshing out the anime side of the game as much as possible. This is especially the case for Sakuna, who experiences character growth, turning from a selfish to a selfless and sacrificial person, seeing everyone as valuable people that she spent the fair amount of time getting by, growing rice and singing the game's iconic Rice Planting song, as well as eliminating demons of nuisance alongside Ashigumo, who investigates the Isle of Demons that's connected to his tribe. Massive props for keeping the game-to-anime experience as authentic as possible.

Of the 3 P.A. Works shows in this Summer season, I've got to hand it over to this show for being the bright and gorgeous, almost pleasant feeling that perfectly captures the vibe of the game translated over to the anime, though Mayonaka Punch is equally just as good, if not on a different roster being of the dark and gritty vibe. Regardless, this is a valiant effort from a studio that has consistently wowed the audience with quality...if you forget the nonsense that was Na Nare Hana Nare a.k.a Narenare: Cheer for You!.

The music is even better and matches the game's vibe with its melancholic take despite its action fantasy. It's no surprise given the experience of yet another veteran working for the show: music composer Yoshiaki Fujisawa, and like Jukki Hanada, is the face of reassured quality to match. I may not have heard much of Ikimonogakari (barring that Yozakura-san Chi no Daisakusen a.k.a Mission: Yozakura Family's 1st Cour OP is the most recent song), but what I can tell you, is that ""Hare!"" is definitely the pop rock duo's best song to date, and a song that, more than it being my favourite OP of the season (in a season of disappointing OPs), it fits perfectly into the show's rhythm naturally. It's the same story with Little Glee Monster's ED with the calm and traditional feels, and I couldn't be happier for this.

All in all, Tensui no Sakuna-hime a.k.a Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin is more than just a commercial success of a game; its anime adaptation is even more underrated, replicating the subtle gentleness of a world so busy with things happening left and right, that its simple and cozy moments are the definition of a slow-paced, but heartwarming show that'll hit you in the feels indefinitely for a faithful adaptation. It's IMO the best of the 3 P.A. Works shows for the Summer 2024 season, and you opt NOT to miss this one, now that the time's right to binge and (possibly) experience the gane for yourself when all is said and done."
58357,538772.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"It's most unusual for an anime to be about, and involve a topic, that the target audience already knows. A first line that makes you think ""Well, I don't know how to plant rice, so that sentence is wrong"". I'm not talking about planting rice. But this story isn't about planting rice alone, of course they plant rice and sometimes fight demons as the synopsis says, but that's assuming that planting rice isn't an activity humanity has done and improved on for ages, a span of time so long that took decades of arduous progress and development until the current state which doesn't even remotely resemble anyof the techniques you actually see in this show, but if there's 1 thing that was necessary for that to happen, it wasn't ingenuity, or creativity, invention, progress, all of that comes after.

I'm talking about patience.

This is a story about patience and hard work, simple as that, and those themes are replicated into almost any facet of the story and characters, excluding developments that specifically occur to discuss the other side of the coin involving too much patience, or conformity, which I won't discuss because it involves heavy spoilers, just know this is one of those shows that argues against it's own messages and themes to truly dismantle them into a genuine exploration of the topic. -This is what good writing looks like, beyond storytelling and logic, even a bad story with a good thematic heart creates an outstanding product.
I can confidently say that this is one of the best videogame anime adaptations.

Sakuna's characters are honestly VERY annoying at the start of the show, they complain too much, they don't do anything but loaf around, and they actively act against their current situation. Being that 4 of the 6 main characters are children (albeit one of those a god), it's expected for you to hear them whine and display a lack of responsibility. THIS DOESN'T MEAN THE CHARACTERS ARE BAD, IT MEANS THEY HAVE A LOT OF SPACE TO DEVELOP.
I'm absolutely tired of the 2024 anime landscape where characters have to start off already strong, yes they can throw a ball 1000 meters with no training, yes they have effortlessly ridden the world of a horrible menace, but in the end, all it takes is for them to be immediately likable, and for secondary characters to constantly remind the audience about the character's supposed ""weakness"". Development for these characters is then forced and unnatural, where the writers simply create the illusion of progress without actually letting it feel earned.
Sakuna is not that show, in a breath of fresh air, these characters actually develop throughout the story into important roles for the survival of the group, they all get past their biases and past mistakes/incorrect assumptions. Come episode 12, I realized this show could make me emotional for the characters even with no more than those 12 episodes, because I've seen them grow and can compare the difference between their original selves and their new, better selves. I was happy and satisfied to see these characters grow with a real journey behind them, unlike the characters from most modern anime who use their ""appealing personality"" to carry their entire arc.
THIS is how Sakuna rewards patience. The characters grow slowly and steadily, mimicking the rice harvesting process, which is a ridiculous theme-story connection, but only a show about planting rice could do it successfully.
Not only that, but even if you remove the growth aspect of the equation, this show's characters have pretty simple yet interesting backstories, one of the characters is a 3 year old who has regressed to their 1 year old self due to severe trauma, and I think that is insane, trust me when I say that's far from the only surprise this cast has in store.

Being an adaptation of a videogame, the story is admittedly a little awkward, while I didn't feel it to be rushed at all, the plot has a lot of holes that are clearly explored in the source game and not in the show, it seems the writers preferred to focus on the great characters, losing some of the story in the process. I am more than fine with this, because as I already mentioned, this character driven show does that aspect spectacularly. The story too, is quite simple, Sakuna the brat is banished to the island where her parents met, so she can clean the island of demons while planting rice, because she's a harvest goddess so well cultivated rice increases her power. It's a simple premise and the execution isn't far off either, the first half of the show dedicates it's time to the story of the crew learning to harvest rice, with a few character-grounded episodes in between, while the later half explores the necessary steps to go deep into the mountain to destroy the evil demon within. The simplicity of the story is one of those aspects I find agreeable, so if you are reading this to figure out weather you want to watch the show, consider the story itself is simple, with the characters being the focus. That doesn't mean this story isn't emotional, I was genuinely surprised at how much the show managed to deliver emotional beats. Similarly, that doesn't mean the story is senseless, I was just less often surprised at how much plot points interconnected, tho I must confess they are often thematically relevant in discussing the virtues of rice farming as well.

We love us some fantastic animation, and I cannot say this show has ""fantastic animation"". I lean more towards ""golden"", it rarely feels unfinished or unpolished, but I won't pretend the most ambitious shot in the show isn't in the opening.  It has some CGI rice, which off putted a lot of people out of watching the show at the start, but it's honestly not a big deal as the CGI doesn't play off the 2D animation too much, it's easy to dismiss it to the background because it's unimportant.
Where the show truly shines visually is the designs. HOLY are some of the designs in this show great! The main cast all has a different build and palette, which is one of the elements that originally attracted me to this show, watching the character of Tauemon be chonky next to an overgrown baby truly shows the range. Then you got the demon designs, including the absolutely cute bunnies and other animal monster creatures that are inspired by Yokai, I can say some of those design are a little uninspired, including a recurrent enemy that just looks like a Stalmoblin straight out of breath of the wild, but any important design tends to shine a lot more and express a ton of personality, that totally makes up for the mid-budget animation. This of course also applies to the general environment design of the game giving everything a pretty unique sheen as well.
I also appreciate the large amount of bunnies and unnecessary details that bring a lot of charm to the animation, despite it's limits.
I think sound is pretty much awesome. It's not the peak of sound design, but it doesn't stay short. Great soundtracks, and generally good voice acting, tho I imagine some people would be bothered at some of the squeaky voices and accents.

Ultimately, this is a show I'd rate pretty highly on characters and themes alone, all those aspects play off within eachother, making a satisfying watch that rewards those willing to get past the initial appearance of the characters, because they are an absolute highlight in a landscape where stories rarely dare to make through development without resorting to storytelling tricks. 
It has souch an appealing and tranquil vibe but knows when to turn away from it to deliver on the experience, I believe it transmits the experience of growing rice through it's story, phasing and atmosphere, truly one of the biggest anime recommendations I can give!"
58357,538893.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"A pretty chill anime with a really chill vibe. As someone who thought I'd drop this on the first episode, I ended up keeping up with it--if only because I enjoyed the art style and vibe to it. There's nothing particularly special about Sakuna: of Rice and Ruin. It's one that requires patience and being able to get past the first episode where it gives a terrible first impression between the character introductions and the fact that the main focus of the games, the plot itself, /the rice/... is super CGI. Something that can be a big turn off for a lot of people, meincluded. But it was only the rice? Sure why not.

Regardless of this first impression, I found myself feeling comfortable with the overall art style and the cozyness with it. I enjoy the ending theme song most of all.  Most of your beginning cast of characters aren't very likeable at the start and they don't really grow on you until much later. And even when they do ""grow"", it's very minimal. A lot of what I really wanted to see and learn, you don't really get to until the final few episodes. Of Sakuna's actual fighting plot, the enemies, finding things out about her parents... the real meat of it you'll find in those last episodes.

Before that however? This anime reminded me of my childhood days where I'd turn on the tv and a pokemon cartoon would be showing. Because it's very much like watching a children's show and the way the character's personalities are is very akin to those olden days of watching cliche anime like that.

The anime isn't bad, but it's not great. It's average at best, and truly is enjoyable... sometimes. I'd go into this with tempered expectations."
58357,538878.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"First things first, I LOVE the game this Anime is based on, so I review from a point of comparison and focus less on character and story progression. Tensui no Sakuna-hime is a game adaption of ""Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin"" which is a mix of 2D Hack 'n Slay and 3D Rice farming while containing some RPG elements like the crafting of clothes and weapons. However, as you may know Anime adaptions of video games are kinda a gamble - there are great ones like Persona 4, pretty solid ones like Valkyria Chronicles, and such disappointments you regret you ever watched it (I'm looking atyou, Corpse Party). So which type is Sakuna-hime? Well, let me explain.

If you played the game, you will notice the producers of this Anime didn't just played it as well, they LOVED it! You have the same outfits and voice actors of the characters, the mountain pass, the fields, the cabins are perfectly adapted as well - hell, they even sit in the same order while eating diner. You have some of the comments Sakuna uses in the game like when she steps on the watered field. On plus, every episode contains some information about rice and its planting.
So yeah, they didn't produced this Anime just for the sake of it, you can feel they put their heart in it!

But as I pointed out in another review, an adaption can - but doesn't has to - be close to its source material, so how about the changes?
Well, in the game you have a lot of fighting to explore the island and collect materials, but here, they kept out a lot. On the one hand it's understandable that you can't focus too much on the fights if you only have 13 episodes to tell such a wide story (24 to 26 episodes would have been better), but therefore it's kinda hard to feel all the pressure Sakuna is going through at the beginning of the story. I mean, yes, there are some short fight scenes, but it's only mentioned and not really shown that she has to do so like every day while also planting the rice.
Furthermore, some chronological orders were changed, but not really for the better - the story about Kinta, Yui and the Crane for example takes place in the later game but here it's in the first half of the Anime which let to lose some impact. The same problem occurs within the last episodes with the drama around Tama which they cramed in only one episode instead of building it up in the middle of the story and fulfil it near the end. Therefore it also lacks of impact. Oh... and a similar issue is there when it comes to the volcano and Kokorowa-hime.
Also, there is no mentioning what will happan to all the characters after the end of the story like you had in the game.

However, that all is complaining at a high level since you have a lot of effort put in this Anime and I just can repeat myself that 13 episodes are way too short for such a wide story. That's why when I saw there will be an Anime adaption, I thought they would do 2 seasons to capture everything. So my biggest criticism is just that the Anime is too short, which leads in my opinion to the problem, that the first half feels more like a kind of slice of life and the second part like it forced the rest of the story to happen (even if I wouldn't know the game).
The art is solid and nothing special, but THANK GOD there is no shitty CGI in it! The music is just on top! Most of the time you have the music of the game, which let you feel home if you played it, and the OP and ED just fit perfect and send you good vibes - especially the OP.

In Conclusion, this adaption is solid to great. This Anime has a lot of heart and effort in it and let you feel everything from joy to concern to hope. The only weakness is that it's too short and would has need more episodes to capture everything and to keep a better pacing. But either way, you will have a good time watching it.
If I wouldn't know and love the game, I would say it's just a solid 7 and recommand, from a perspective of a game adaption an 8 or maybe 9 with little mixed feelings.
So, since we unfortunately don't have a 7.5 rating, I round up to 8 and recommand ;)"
58357,539154.0,5.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Game adaptations are definitely an interesting medium. One way or another, they're very loose adaptations of their game counterpart due to the game in nature being a completely different experience -- usually spending tens of hours to complete. How does one adapt those hours of gameplay into a mere four hour adaptation? Mobile games, in my experience actually tend to have the most success. Surprisingly, the production value of mobile game anime adaptations tend to be the highest, with a solid plot that the original game might not have been able to produce in it's mobile medium. Examples can be Rage of Bahamut Genesis (only season1 let's be honest here) or Magatsu Wahrheit: Zuerst. 

Tensui no Sakuna hime? It's a console game. Still, I don't judge. The first six or so episodes were good, especially the first 3 or so. It's about farming on a remote island, with a main character that acts spoiled, but slowly comes to age as the story progresses. Whether it be doing minor chores, taking on major responsibilities, or acting as a mediator, Sakuna-hime goes from a pampered spoiled god to someone that is shouldered with a bit of responsibility as a Goddess of Harvest. Sakuna-hime is a great character that's multifaceted and experiences many dynamic changes due to the challenges and hurdles she's forced to confront. 

However, that's where all the magic stops happening. When the show becomes less about character development and farming, then it starts going downhill. Suddenly, a show about farming and developing land and character interaction becomes some third rate shounen anime about beating the evil god. Of course, this theme about demons looming around is certainly a theme that was always behind the scenes, but to so suddenly only focus about fighting was a wrong move. You're subject to the most one dimensional villains with self-righteous dialogue from Sakuna-hime and the rest of the cast that it's sickening. Yet another cliche-filled dialogue about how ""we have to stop the cycle of hatred,"" and yet none of the main characters are forced to make a difficult moral decision. Rather, despite letting go villains and evil-doers constantly, the issue resolves by itself. By ""forgiving everyone,"" Sakuna-hime and her people are able to still easily be absolved of any consequences due to plot armor. The final boss is similarly boring plot armor fights where feelings and sentiments are more important than the fight itself.

Additionally, I never said that the side characters were good. Tama is good just because he's mentoring/a close companion of Sakuna, but the rest of the characters -- especially the human ones -- are extremely cliche. Kinta was supposed to be a reclusive, polemic yet perhaps misunderstood or kind character that could have been explored a lot more than it should have. His whole arc with Yui kind of makes sense, but it just seems quite rushed and there's not enough exploration into the character relations afterwards for me to care. In fact, after Kinta's and Yui's character arc, he kind of just becomes a completely different character, which is to say he becomes a nice and generic side character that never contributes to the plot again. Tauemon, Myrthe, and Kaimaru are also similar in that there are some surface level descriptions of all of them, none of which are going into depth, and they also similarly contribute literally nothing to the story other than sometimes functioning as a plot device to a Hero's Journey. 

If all of the human characters were likeable, the slice of life farming with some fights and magical happenings could have carried the entire show for 12 episodes, but unfortunately that would require good writing capabilities. Instead, if you slap an already failing cast of side characters and shove them away to make way for a generic and below average shounen show about beating the big bad boss guy, it's still slop, but you can get away with the terrible writing you had in the initial half of the show.

Art was fine, probably above average definitely when it comes to character design, details, and renders, but it was quite obvious that 90% of the budget was focused on the first few episodes where the visuals were quite a few notches above the latter parts of the show.

Overall, an uninspired anime adaptation that could have been great if it focused on character development and better writing."

59390,535703.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"As a massive fan of the terminator franchise who’s watched all the movies dozens of times growing up with my dad, I can say this was the best instalment since T2 Judgement Day. It’s thrilling, engaging, thought provoking and a great evolution of the franchise. Hopefully this is a sign of things to come. Terminator Zero starts off clearly reminiscent of earlier instalments of the series, borrowing concepts from the first two films, the spin off tv series and more, but by the halfway point it establishes itself as something unique. While yes it has cool fights and action scenes, the character drama and philosophical questionsthe series poses are much more important. Rather than focus on Arnold Schwarzenegger beating up another terminator to save humanity, we get asked the question of whether or not humanity is even worth being saved. The other entries have always treated this as a given. As if humans have some divine right to the planet, as if we can take whatever we want with no consequences. If you left that judgement to one of our own, the answer would always be “yes, we deserve to live” but in reality this is a simple self preservation instinct rather than objective truth. Throughout the course of its 8 episode run, Terminator Zero has humanity judged by a non biased third party with the core objective being convincing this third party that it should aid humanity in the struggle against skynet. I loved this so much and found it very refreshing. 

This is very much a character driven story. I quickly grew attached to the kids and Misaki especially. I think the one downside I’d have here is that Eiko felt a little flat, I wonder if that’s intentional because they want to flesh her out in future media given some circumstances in the end of the series. Other than that, I was on the edge of my seat every episode hoping everyone would make it out of this alive. I’d encourage you to really pay attention to the characters’ subtle behaviours and idiosyncrasies as well. There’s some cool twists at the end that are foreshadowed throughout and it was so cool when we got there and I was able to look back and be like “ah, that’s why__” for 8 episodes, there’s quite a bit of good stuff in this one. 

Production IG are no strangers to sci fi and they brought their A games here. Visuals and soundtrack are incredible, character designs as well. The few big fight scenes we have looked awesome too. Show is well paced and pulls you in from the get go. 

Highly recommend this as a must watch for any terminator fan or sci fi fan in general. Honestly for younger people who haven’t seen the OG films(you need to ASAP since they’re legendary), this could serve as a good entry point for the franchise. Very happy with what we got.

Terminator Zero gets 9, out of 10."
59390,535680.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Absolutely insane timing to release this on Judgement Day itself. I'll admit, I initially scoffed at the thought of a Terminator anime but then remember what franchise this is and very quickly changed my tune. This is basically a franchise with 2.5 good films, 1 solid TV show that got canned too soon and 1 pretty awesome video game, now we can add a brilliant anime series to its legacy. Gorgeously brutal animation, terrific voice work and sets a solid framework for an ongoing story that is, like the best parts of the franchise, as much about very human choices as it is about spectacle.There's propulsive action scenes, thoughtful writing and brilliant emotional dynamics between its cast of characters. The feature films may have become a lost cause, but Terminator Zero is just getting started. From action packed moments of pure adrenaline, to softer moments that will give viewers chills, this show delivers and does a great job of bringing something new and unique to this series by fully embracing the horror elements. Humanity’s battle against AI super-soldiers hasn’t been this fun in years."
59390,535891.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Approaching ""Terminator 0"" with no particular expectations and little memory of the original franchise, I was intrigued by the series' fresh perspective, centering on a Japanese scientist. The initial episodes of the anime were surprisingly engaging, characterized by minimal dialogue, intense gore, and some development of the characters, which provided a solid foundation for the story. However, the series takes a noticeable turn in the latter half, particularly after a pivotal plot twist. This shift transforms the narrative focus extensively towards theoretical discussions, overshadowing the more action-oriented aspects that one might expect from a Terminator series. The balance tilts heavily towards lengthy dialogues and complex information,which may deter viewers hoping for more traditional sci-fi action.

The portrayal of the scientist's children, particularly the eldest, introduces family dynamics that could have added depth but instead felt frustrating. This character, designed as a typical know-it-all, often seems to detract from the plot rather than enrich it.

Visually, the anime fluctuates in quality. There are moments where the animation appears lackluster, betraying signs of inconsistency, while at other times, it delivers brilliantly, capturing the intense and dynamic essence of the series. The integration of time travel and time loops is a highlight, offering a clever narrative technique that keeps the viewer guessing about the story’s conclusion—whether it ends or perpetually loops.

Despite these intriguing elements, the series struggles to maintain a consistent tone. The shift from a relatively straightforward action to a heavily dialogue-driven second half feels jarring. While the exploration of physics and science might appeal to some, it feels somewhat misplaced in a series that bears the Terminator name, as the iconic elements of the franchise take a backseat to these discussions.

In summary, ""Terminator 0"" offers a mixed experience. The series starts strong but loses momentum as it delves into theoretical realms. It might suit viewers looking for a casual watch with elements of science fiction and action, but those seeking a focused narrative on the Terminator itself might find the series diverges too far from its roots."
59390,535682.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"In short this feels like a fanfic of someone, who really liked the first two Terminator movies. Additionally he threw a bit of animatrix into the mix and got someone on board, who had lots of experience in doing sci-fi series with lots of robots, androids, etc.: Production I.G. The story starts simple and becomes convoluted later on with its twist and turns, for better and for worse. On top of that one thing, that ticked me off, was the plot armor, it starts literally in the first scene and it continues throughout the series. On a more positive note the animation and visuals work quitewell, even though they mixed in CG for the machines and robots. The soundtrack is overall solid and has also a flair of fanservice, if you listen for it. With a runtime of 8 episodes the anime is shortlived, which is to a degree a positive, because I had at no point the feeling that the show dragged, yet it also results in a lack of character depth for the rather large cast. I found most characters either basic or underdeveloped. Alas, as this is the fifth thing, I watched out of the Terminator franchise (Terminator 1-3 and Salvation were the other.), I would put in place 3 and rank it a little bit higher than Terminator 3, though it has been ages since I saw that one. In the end I would recommend this for more casual Terminator fans, who don't mind some nonsense here and there. For everyone else, if you look for a sci-fi action show to gulp down, here is your poison, otherwise look for something else. 7-"
59390,537354.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"""Terminator 0"" is an anime TV series available on Netflix that attempts to bring the iconic franchise into the world of animation. Story/Plot: 6/10 The plot follows the familiar Terminator formula, which is enjoyable at first but becomes predictable about halfway through. The minimal payoff is disappointing, as key questions are left unanswered for a sequel. Character development feels inorganic, and the plot relies too heavily on creating shock value instead of building a cohesive narrative. One of the biggest issues is the inconsistent portrayal of the Terminator. It feels artificially weak to serve the plot, which ruins any stakes the story tries to create. There’sa scene where a human tank blows from the Terminator, even though it had been established as far stronger than humans. This lack of consistency damages the believability of the plot.

Animation/Design: 7/10
Production I.G.’s animation is as good as expected, but the unnatural highlights on characters in situations where there shouldn’t be a light source are distracting. The action scenes are visually solid, but the way the Terminator’s skin deflects bullets without damage takes away from the immersion. 

Characters: 5/10
The characters were not likable, and their development was shallow. Many decisions they made felt like plot devices rather than reflections of genuine personality. The relationship dynamics had potential but were underdeveloped. The father and eldest son were particularly disappointing, with the father speaking in riddles and avoiding crucial answers. The world felt empty, as if the main cast were the only characters with any importance, and the Terminator itself was weakened to the point of losing its menacing presence.

Audio/Soundtrack: 6/10
The voice acting in the English dub was good, but the soundtrack didn’t leave an impression. The lack of iconic music or sound from previous Terminator entries was a missed opportunity, which might have helped elevate the experience. Nothing about the audio stood out as memorable or unique.

Enjoyment: 5/10
While some elements were enjoyable, the show ultimately fell flat. Poor character development, a predictable plot, and a Terminator that felt inconsistent and weak made the overall experience lackluster. The stakes never felt real, given how poorly the Terminator was handled in terms of power and danger. The weak portrayal of the Terminator, like being pushed back by a regular human and failing to land a finishing blow, undermined the excitement of the action sequences.

Overall: 6/10
""Terminator 0"" introduces some interesting ideas but falls short due to its weak portrayal of the Terminator and an incoherent plot. The Terminator’s inconsistencies significantly hurt the tension, making the human vs. machine dynamic feel unbelievable. While the sequel may resolve some of these issues, it’s not a series that leaves you eagerly anticipating the next installment. Rewatching it after the sequel might make for a better experience, but at this point, it’s lacking in too many areas to fully enjoy."
59390,536036.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"With the recent surge of anime adaptations based on established Western franchises, such as ""Suicide Squad"" , I was curious to see how the Terminator series would fare in its own anime. And unlike the disappointing Suicide Squad isekai anime, I felt that this adaptation was handled well. Even though I've never been a huge fan of the Terminator franchise and am not entirely familiar with its lore, I ended up enjoying this anime. The story told here is pretty coherent and it makes sense even with limited knowledge. The essence of the terminator movies is captured surprisingly well, transmitting the feeling of a darkdystopian world where machines took over. This anime includes plenty of gore and blood, but it doesn’t feel out of place. It's believable that a killing machine would brutally tear through anything in its path.

The characters and plot are solid for what they are. Each character has their own flaws, and while eight episodes don’t provide much time for deep character development or extensive backstory, you still come to understand their motivations and actions. The plot also has a few twists and turns, some of which genuinely surprised me. The time travel elements are straightforward, with clear indications of the year in which the story is currently taking place, which helps prevent any confusion.

The soundtrack is somewhat underwhelming, as it doesn't really stand out. The animation is generally well done, though there are moments where heavy use of CGI is noticeable and doesn't look great. This is especially true in scenes where Malcolm is talking in a room with an AI named Kokoro. During wide shots, the CGI makes his model appear odd and lifeless.  The voice acting is excellent, featuring many recognizable names from popular mainstream anime.

I admittedly felt a bit skeptical about Terminator Zero but came out of the experience with a net positive feeling. It is not a masterpiece by any means or features the best writing but it can absolutely be enjoyed even as someone who has seen little or nothing about the Terminator franchise because it is written in such a way that you do not need it. For me, this was a solid anime to watch in between other shows. With only eight episodes, it’s a quick watch. It was enjoyable as it is, without needing to be anything more or overly complicating it."

Terminator 0 is a really fun watch that's also quite easy to get into, as it's only 8 episodes long.

Still, Terminator 0 does scratch a similar itch to what Pluto did. Every interaction with the Terminator was extremely intense, building perfect tension and suspense that leads you into being so unsure of how everything couldplay out. I've never seen the Terminator movies, but this anime convinces me I need to. 

You will not regret watching Terminator 0. It's fast and easy to watch, but you also gain so much satisfaction from the story and animation. You don't get a fully realized character development, but that's only because a season 2 is implied.

Not exaggerating. The plot and story is very good. Most of the main characters and the terminator are likeable . They almost never make any dumb decisions. The music is the perfect blend of something new and a bit of judegment day's theme. The gore is alright but ive seen better, There's a handful of nostalgic callback scenes from the original first 2 movies . the terminator felt almost like arnold's terminator from the first movie, like anunstoppable killing machine that almost no one can help u escape , hes also very mysterious, reminds me of a homeless toji zenin . I love that this anime cleared up a lot about the effects of time traveling and changing the past and how it effects the future with the war and skynet . Although its only 8 episodes i appreciate that there's almost never a dull moment . Seeing a T-800 dual wielding M82 50.cal sniper rifles is prob the most badass thing ive seen in anything terminator related, like it honestly tops Arnold's shotgun on a motorcycle flip reload and minigun scene. 

I have a few complains
The CGI for the terminator's skeleton and the AIs holograms were a complete eye soar, they stood out pretty badly since everything else looks really good but ive seen way worse cgi to be fair . 
I hated the plot armor on a certain character is absolutely annoying, like she straights up fist fights and shoves T-800s around as if they dont weight a couple hundred kilos more than an adult human and as if they're not made of titanium . 
The kids were very annoying , they were straight up war of the world kids level of annoying . 
It felt as if the creator was a hardcore fanboy of spy family and just wanted a Yor forger in the series in the form of Misaki with how she fights and same voice actor."

 Well...the plot starts slowly, at first it may seem too straightforward and sometimes a bit boring, the rather bloody action didn't help either, because it was filled with a lot of nonsense and was lazily written, which I will mention at the end.  But from a certain point the plot is much more intricate, surprising and focused, we get really few ""unnecessary scenes"" at the beginning everything seemed very predictable and it was, but towards the end we got some really interesting plot twists that made more or less sense, as for all this nonsense about time travel which I personally hate because in this type of plots there is always a lot of stupidity and paradoxes, but this anime seems to be aware of it and explains quite well how all this stuff about going back in time really works, that it is impossible to change the future, despite this the whole plot is based on the fact that Skynet sends the Terminator for this purpose, although it will not affect the time from which it was sent, additionally some facts that will be explained at the end make me feel that there is a lack of any consequence in all this.  Most of the time we observe two main plots, namely how the characters chase each other with the terminator (it is done in a more or less satisfying way) and how the MC lies/sits/stands and talks to his AI trying to convince it to help humanity and stop Skynet but the cold calculation of the AI that sees no reason for humans to survive, apart from their selfish survival instinct, is a tough opponent haha
We get a lot of interesting moral dilemmas, although all these moral and philosophical considerations are just long monologues from the characters who speak directly, the anime does not present it in a particularly interesting way, the AI will simply give you a whole argument about how ""humans are evil, they are a cancer to the Earth and must be eliminated"" blah blah.

Sometimes it seems that the series has too much pathos during the MC's conversations with the AI ​​and tries to be smarter than it really is, which can give way towards the end because I think that this plot ultimately turned out to be a bit too naive and too easily resolved, but still this whole plot is interesting, it can provoke thought and we get some pretty interesting concepts.

But getting back to the plot in general, almost all the plots develop nicely (although the Skynet plot seemed a bit ignored) and connect with each other, characters that at first glance might seem uninteresting get some nice development, characters have to make really difficult decisions, everyone has the right amount of time, mainly because we don't really have too many characters here.
Of course, not all of them are particularly interesting and the interesting ones aren't outstanding, but everyone gets ""something"", has their own task and doesn't seem like a complete filler.
 Mr. Terminator, who at first seems bland and makes no impression at all with his bulging eyes, becomes really cool and generally expressive throughout the anime, I like how often she changed clothes, once we had a slicked-down man in a suit and once we had some I don't know... shaman or something haha
Another plus is that the world reacts to everything that's happening and the police/military are interested, although it wasn't on such a scale (especially when it comes to the military) that I would have expected but still, the world is alive, but due to the limited budget, the cities seem deserted.

Unfortunately, we also get a few plot simplifications and quite a lot of stupidity, for example, the resistance movement, which in the post-apocalyptic future barely makes ends meet, is able to steal ultra-important data on time travel from Skynet, which was protected (from what we saw) by only one Terminator, additionally they are able to build a damn time machine... not very credible.
 Terminator slaughters randoms who have no self-preservation instinct and attack him, sacrificing their lives for our main characters (randoms from their perspective) and our heroes don't even mention it and the plot forgets about their ""glorious deeds"" XDD

Action scenes:
The accuracy of the character depends on the scenario, the character runs straight and the machine specialized in killing cannot hit him, really, I don't know who came up with this, how on earth these bullets don't hit.

We also have a lot of plot armor where the characters survive impossible situations, the antagonist, although previously presented as ruthless and finishing off his victims, suddenly after defeating the main character, they leave him just like that without killing him, just because the scenario tells them to.
 Eiko seems like a human terminator and her endurance and skills/strength are simply poorly written, which made it hard to feel respect for the Terminator at the beginning, because he gets his ass kicked by a ""regular woman"" yes, he keeps getting up and may seem like an unstoppable force but after the 10th time you manage to knock him down, it doesn't make such an impression anymore, at least that's how it was at the beginning, then it seems better, the action scenes also seem more logical in general, which means they are finally satisfying, brutality and a lot of blood definitely help with all of this.

Animation:
Mmm...it's not bad, although it's not good either, you could say it's average.

We get a lot of, often not very good CGI and a bit of recycled animation.

2D is pretty decent but could have been better, the animation is often quite wooden but of course we also get a few really good sequences so despite everything there's something to look forward to.
 We also have a censorship that I hate, where instead of setting the ""camera"" at such an angle that you can't see intimate places, you just draw boobs without nipples, it looks so weird that..yeah.
Overall, if I were to rate the animation itself, a 6/10 would be a reasonable rating.

The soundtrack also deserves special mention, as it was able to turn up the excitement of a given scene.


To sum up... it's simply worth watching, even though my review is quite critical.

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐❌❌❌❌"
59390,535955.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Terminator Zero is kinda infuriating but kino nonetheless The newest installation of the Terminator series brought us back right before the Judgement Day of 1997 from the eyes of Malcolm Lee, a scientist developing another artificial intelligence called Kokoro to rival skynet and stop the judgment day itself. Aside from Malcolm, we also seeing things from the perspective of Reiko and Misaki, both of which actually holds another key roles of the story. Characters in Terminator Zero are written quite nicely with some development and lots of mystery around them. The kids however written in such a way that will infuriate the audience and I guaranteeyour frustration watching two thirds of the series. But in the end of the day you'll understand that they're just kids and with what they've been through, man it's kinda hard not to sympathize with them in the end. Oh and they also got some nice development with one huge plot point being placed on one of the kid's shoulder. 

So, how's the plot written? Well since it's another Terminator entry, do expect a lot of cat and mouse game with A TON OF EXPOSITION AND TONS AND TONS OF TWIST IN THE END. The plot progress rather slowly but steadily aproaching a climax which in my case made me ponder for a while. The action and the chase scene iconic to the Terminator series is really delivered here with some call back to the original films. Not gonna lie, there's a few moment which I actually jumped a bit when the characters are being hunted by the terminator. 

As for the animation quality, Production I.G did pretty well animating the series. Never did I expect a Terminator anime but here we are. It's not Mappa or Wit kind of animation with their fast, fluid and smooth action scene nor the insanely detailed and painting-like quality of Kyoani or Comixwave but its still a decently animated anime. The fight scenes are a bit slow but heavy, the power which the Terminator holds are terrifyingly shown with a great amount of Gore. 
Sound design is meh, not really the best but not terrible. The guns sounds kinda weak and the music is forgettable. Oddly enough for me the best scenes in the series is actually when there's no music at all since it's focused on the dialogue which usually dropped a bomb. 

So yeah, that's my short review of the Terminator Zero. Tldr? 
It has a lot of flaws but it's definitely better than some of the latest Terminator movies. Ngl kinda want to kms watching the kids from ep 1-6 DEAR GOD THEY'RE THE WORST. But damn the last few episodes are just damnnn. 

I absolutely recommends you to watch it especially if you're a terminator fans or maybe a sucker for time travel shenanigans.

P. S my writing skill is a bit rusty so I practiced by writing this review entirely in english. Thanks for reading, cheers 🍻"
59390,535874.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Oh man, where do I even begin? If you're expecting a classic Terminator experience, you might be in the wrong place. This anime deviates significantly from the usual paths of the franchise and could even lead you to skip some scenes. The anime essentially consists of 50% philosophical dialogues and 50% Terminator-ish action. Rough Summary: Terminator Zero takes place parallel to the events of Terminator 3: Judgment Day, but in an alternate scenario in Japan. The plot follows Malcolm, a scientist who develops an AI to avert the threat of Skynet, and his three children. Central to the story are also Eiko, a resistance fighter fromthe future, a maid named Misaki who plays a significant role in the family, and a Terminator sent from the future to stop their mission. 

Philosophical depth and new approaches: The anime endeavors to add a deeper, philosophical level to the franchise. It deals with whether humanity deserves to be saved at all and what this means for the future. This line of thought is very reminiscent of works like Vivi, beatless and I, Robot. Rather than relying solely on raw action, Terminator Zero attempts to explore themes such as the value of human life and the logic of an AI.

The Terminator — Between threat and disappointment: The portrayal of the Terminator unfortunately fluctuates between terrifying menace and almost laughable helplessness. In some scenes he shows off his superhuman abilities, only to be effortlessly stopped by almost every character, even children, in other moments. This inconsistency robs it of much of the menace one would expect from a cold-blooded killing machine. Especially with a 17+ age rating, one might have expected harsher, more uncompromising action—perhaps something in the style of Mortal Kombat because of the weapon laws… Instead, the potential of this threat remains unfulfilled, and the often-absurd plot armor protects the characters from consequences that should seem unavoidable.

Visuals and soundtrack: On a positive note, Terminator Zero is visually quite impressive. The animations are solid, and the CGI is well integrated, even if it doesn't reach the level of a Cyberpunk: Edgerunner. There are some well-staged scenes that are pleasing to the eye, and the dark atmosphere is captured effectively. The soundtrack is solid overall, but the iconic Terminator theme is unfortunately only replaced by an uninspiring resample if I remember correctly, which detracts from the nostalgia factor.

Plot (Mild Spoilers) – Complex but Not Always Consistent: The plot develops into a complex web of intrigue and time travel throughout the series, leading to some surprising twists. This complexity is interesting on one hand, but it also results in inconsistencies, particularly in the logic of the time travel that is introduced.

Conclusion: Terminator Zero offers some fascinating new approaches and isn’t afraid to raise deeper philosophical questions. Visually, the anime is also convincing, and there are some exciting moments. However, despite these positive aspects, the series struggles with inconsistent character portrayals and a weak Terminator that loses much of its threatening presence. For fans who are open to new ideas and willing to engage with the philosophical discussions, Terminator Zero might still be worth a look. However, those expecting a return to the roots of the franchise might be disappointed.

59390,536086.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"My opinion about the Terminator anime: I didn't have much faith in this ""Terminator anime"", but, look, Netflix has been surprising us with some very non-standard animes lately. The style of this anime and its theme gave me a Cyberpunk: Edgerunners vibe. I thought it was going to be another one of those generic ones, just more of the same, but I was wrong. The anime lives up to the franchise, with several references to the films and set in one of the countless timelines that the saga loves to explore. There are some twists that work well, some you expect, others take you bysurprise. 

The children, who I thought were going to be that annoying stereotype, actually have layers, development, and all the characters have their highlight moment in the plot. The action is good and it still has that horror atmosphere that was reminiscent of the first film. And the theme? Very current, talking about artificial intelligence. In the past, we only saw this in movies, and now we are here, surrounded by AI creating music, texts, images, videos…everything. 

The anime also brings some philosophies about life and machines, like several other futuristic films. But this has a difference: at a certain point, you are divided, sometimes on the side of the machines, sometimes on the side of the humans, until you reach the point where you no longer know who is right or wrong. The fine line between good and evil really begins to blur. But there are some moments that don't make sense (the films also suffer from this) that make us wonder: how can a machine miss so many shots and the police too? XD

Anyway, I thought this ""Terminator Zero"" was very good."
59390,537230.0,8.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"I enjoyed Terminator Zero despite not really being a big fan of the source material. I have seen the first two terminator movies and I thought they were pretty good. I just never felt the need to watch any of the others. I thought Terminator Zero did a pretty good job taking the story in a new direction without contradicting the source material. The show had a few twists I did not see coming, and I thought the action and suspense were pretty good. I really enjoyed seeing the surroundings through the Terminator's perspective (like you do in the original movies) in an anime. Thebiggest flaw with the anime itself is that, while not bad, the animation is not quite it. It can be a little bit off-putting at times, and feels a little subpar compared to what Production I.G. can do. Additionally, there is a big plot-hole in the story. Why did the computer scientist not simply bring his children to a saferoom inside the labs to begin with (or somewhere else with the same level of protection), if he suspected that technology was going to rise against humans."
59390,536455.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"The tricky thing about developing new entries in the Terminator franchise is that they have to contain some pretty specific plot and character elements in order to be recognisable as Terminator stories. Omit the titular robot assassins or drastically alter their purpose and it wouldn't be a Terminator story. But equally, stick too closely to the established elements and you end up with something that feels derivative and pointless. It's a fine line to ride, and Terminator Zero attempts it with varying levels of success. Your cyborg assassin for the evening is an off-the-peg T800, the premium vanilla of murderbots. The story doesn't attempt any newgimmicks with the terminator itself, but it gives a solid showing for the old classic. Meanwhile, a grizzled future soldier is sent back in time to stop it. So far, so ""I &lt;3 1984."" Fortunately they're not attempting to kill/save a future military leader, so it diverges from formula there, if only a little. The thing that turns Malcolm into an assassination target isn't entirely untrodden ground for the franchise, but at least isn't something that has been done to death in the movies, so it feels relatively fresh.

Coming from Production IG, it's a lavish-looking show with lots of intense and well-animated action. The nature of the action scenes often isn't particularly imaginative though, in one instance being an almost verbatim rehash of a scene from the original movie. On the other hand, I have no complaints about the eerily understated music, which adds a lot to the tension and atmosphere.

On most fronts, Terminator Zero varies from competent to solid. The main place where it falls short is the characters. They're a generally unlikeable bunch, especially early on, which makes it difficult to care about their fate in the first half of the show. Some of them undergo some oddly abrupt personality shifts too. Malcolm's youngest child suddenly changes from selfish, naive brat to mature and contemplative after her first encounter with the terminator. Meanwhile, future soldier Eiko goes from driven to wishy-washy around the same time, and winds up getting so sidetracked that she almost falls out of the story until the climax.

The other thing playing against the characters is the dubtitles, which have the most overt case of fifteening I've seen since Manga Video's 90s heyday. It flat-out changes the personality of some characters, especially Misaki who sounds polite and demure in the Japanese dialogue, but drops F-bombs in the subtitles.

Complaints aside, the show does get stronger and more distinctive as it goes along. Some of the twists are predictable, but they do serve to make the story more interesting. Overall I'd rank it somewhere in the middle of the franchise: above the messy T3 and the derivative Dark Fate, but significantly below the first two movies and The Sarah Connor Chronicles."
59390,535703.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"As a massive fan of the terminator franchise who’s watched all the movies dozens of times growing up with my dad, I can say this was the best instalment since T2 Judgement Day. It’s thrilling, engaging, thought provoking and a great evolution of the franchise. Hopefully this is a sign of things to come. Terminator Zero starts off clearly reminiscent of earlier instalments of the series, borrowing concepts from the first two films, the spin off tv series and more, but by the halfway point it establishes itself as something unique. While yes it has cool fights and action scenes, the character drama and philosophical questionsthe series poses are much more important. Rather than focus on Arnold Schwarzenegger beating up another terminator to save humanity, we get asked the question of whether or not humanity is even worth being saved. The other entries have always treated this as a given. As if humans have some divine right to the planet, as if we can take whatever we want with no consequences. If you left that judgement to one of our own, the answer would always be “yes, we deserve to live” but in reality this is a simple self preservation instinct rather than objective truth. Throughout the course of its 8 episode run, Terminator Zero has humanity judged by a non biased third party with the core objective being convincing this third party that it should aid humanity in the struggle against skynet. I loved this so much and found it very refreshing. 

This is very much a character driven story. I quickly grew attached to the kids and Misaki especially. I think the one downside I’d have here is that Eiko felt a little flat, I wonder if that’s intentional because they want to flesh her out in future media given some circumstances in the end of the series. Other than that, I was on the edge of my seat every episode hoping everyone would make it out of this alive. I’d encourage you to really pay attention to the characters’ subtle behaviours and idiosyncrasies as well. There’s some cool twists at the end that are foreshadowed throughout and it was so cool when we got there and I was able to look back and be like “ah, that’s why__” for 8 episodes, there’s quite a bit of good stuff in this one. 

Production IG are no strangers to sci fi and they brought their A games here. Visuals and soundtrack are incredible, character designs as well. The few big fight scenes we have looked awesome too. Show is well paced and pulls you in from the get go. 

Highly recommend this as a must watch for any terminator fan or sci fi fan in general. Honestly for younger people who haven’t seen the OG films(you need to ASAP since they’re legendary), this could serve as a good entry point for the franchise. Very happy with what we got.

Terminator Zero gets 9, out of 10."
59390,535680.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Absolutely insane timing to release this on Judgement Day itself. I'll admit, I initially scoffed at the thought of a Terminator anime but then remember what franchise this is and very quickly changed my tune. This is basically a franchise with 2.5 good films, 1 solid TV show that got canned too soon and 1 pretty awesome video game, now we can add a brilliant anime series to its legacy. Gorgeously brutal animation, terrific voice work and sets a solid framework for an ongoing story that is, like the best parts of the franchise, as much about very human choices as it is about spectacle.There's propulsive action scenes, thoughtful writing and brilliant emotional dynamics between its cast of characters. The feature films may have become a lost cause, but Terminator Zero is just getting started. From action packed moments of pure adrenaline, to softer moments that will give viewers chills, this show delivers and does a great job of bringing something new and unique to this series by fully embracing the horror elements. Humanity’s battle against AI super-soldiers hasn’t been this fun in years."
59390,535891.0,5.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"Approaching ""Terminator 0"" with no particular expectations and little memory of the original franchise, I was intrigued by the series' fresh perspective, centering on a Japanese scientist. The initial episodes of the anime were surprisingly engaging, characterized by minimal dialogue, intense gore, and some development of the characters, which provided a solid foundation for the story. However, the series takes a noticeable turn in the latter half, particularly after a pivotal plot twist. This shift transforms the narrative focus extensively towards theoretical discussions, overshadowing the more action-oriented aspects that one might expect from a Terminator series. The balance tilts heavily towards lengthy dialogues and complex information,which may deter viewers hoping for more traditional sci-fi action.

The portrayal of the scientist's children, particularly the eldest, introduces family dynamics that could have added depth but instead felt frustrating. This character, designed as a typical know-it-all, often seems to detract from the plot rather than enrich it.

Visually, the anime fluctuates in quality. There are moments where the animation appears lackluster, betraying signs of inconsistency, while at other times, it delivers brilliantly, capturing the intense and dynamic essence of the series. The integration of time travel and time loops is a highlight, offering a clever narrative technique that keeps the viewer guessing about the story’s conclusion—whether it ends or perpetually loops.

Despite these intriguing elements, the series struggles to maintain a consistent tone. The shift from a relatively straightforward action to a heavily dialogue-driven second half feels jarring. While the exploration of physics and science might appeal to some, it feels somewhat misplaced in a series that bears the Terminator name, as the iconic elements of the franchise take a backseat to these discussions.

In summary, ""Terminator 0"" offers a mixed experience. The series starts strong but loses momentum as it delves into theoretical realms. It might suit viewers looking for a casual watch with elements of science fiction and action, but those seeking a focused narrative on the Terminator itself might find the series diverges too far from its roots."
59390,535682.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"In short this feels like a fanfic of someone, who really liked the first two Terminator movies. Additionally he threw a bit of animatrix into the mix and got someone on board, who had lots of experience in doing sci-fi series with lots of robots, androids, etc.: Production I.G. The story starts simple and becomes convoluted later on with its twist and turns, for better and for worse. On top of that one thing, that ticked me off, was the plot armor, it starts literally in the first scene and it continues throughout the series. On a more positive note the animation and visuals work quitewell, even though they mixed in CG for the machines and robots. The soundtrack is overall solid and has also a flair of fanservice, if you listen for it. With a runtime of 8 episodes the anime is shortlived, which is to a degree a positive, because I had at no point the feeling that the show dragged, yet it also results in a lack of character depth for the rather large cast. I found most characters either basic or underdeveloped. Alas, as this is the fifth thing, I watched out of the Terminator franchise (Terminator 1-3 and Salvation were the other.), I would put in place 3 and rank it a little bit higher than Terminator 3, though it has been ages since I saw that one. In the end I would recommend this for more casual Terminator fans, who don't mind some nonsense here and there. For everyone else, if you look for a sci-fi action show to gulp down, here is your poison, otherwise look for something else. 7-"
59390,537354.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"""Terminator 0"" is an anime TV series available on Netflix that attempts to bring the iconic franchise into the world of animation. Story/Plot: 6/10 The plot follows the familiar Terminator formula, which is enjoyable at first but becomes predictable about halfway through. The minimal payoff is disappointing, as key questions are left unanswered for a sequel. Character development feels inorganic, and the plot relies too heavily on creating shock value instead of building a cohesive narrative. One of the biggest issues is the inconsistent portrayal of the Terminator. It feels artificially weak to serve the plot, which ruins any stakes the story tries to create. There’sa scene where a human tank blows from the Terminator, even though it had been established as far stronger than humans. This lack of consistency damages the believability of the plot.

Animation/Design: 7/10
Production I.G.’s animation is as good as expected, but the unnatural highlights on characters in situations where there shouldn’t be a light source are distracting. The action scenes are visually solid, but the way the Terminator’s skin deflects bullets without damage takes away from the immersion. 

Characters: 5/10
The characters were not likable, and their development was shallow. Many decisions they made felt like plot devices rather than reflections of genuine personality. The relationship dynamics had potential but were underdeveloped. The father and eldest son were particularly disappointing, with the father speaking in riddles and avoiding crucial answers. The world felt empty, as if the main cast were the only characters with any importance, and the Terminator itself was weakened to the point of losing its menacing presence.

Audio/Soundtrack: 6/10
The voice acting in the English dub was good, but the soundtrack didn’t leave an impression. The lack of iconic music or sound from previous Terminator entries was a missed opportunity, which might have helped elevate the experience. Nothing about the audio stood out as memorable or unique.

Enjoyment: 5/10
While some elements were enjoyable, the show ultimately fell flat. Poor character development, a predictable plot, and a Terminator that felt inconsistent and weak made the overall experience lackluster. The stakes never felt real, given how poorly the Terminator was handled in terms of power and danger. The weak portrayal of the Terminator, like being pushed back by a regular human and failing to land a finishing blow, undermined the excitement of the action sequences.

Overall: 6/10
""Terminator 0"" introduces some interesting ideas but falls short due to its weak portrayal of the Terminator and an incoherent plot. The Terminator’s inconsistencies significantly hurt the tension, making the human vs. machine dynamic feel unbelievable. While the sequel may resolve some of these issues, it’s not a series that leaves you eagerly anticipating the next installment. Rewatching it after the sequel might make for a better experience, but at this point, it’s lacking in too many areas to fully enjoy."
59390,536036.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"With the recent surge of anime adaptations based on established Western franchises, such as ""Suicide Squad"" , I was curious to see how the Terminator series would fare in its own anime. And unlike the disappointing Suicide Squad isekai anime, I felt that this adaptation was handled well. Even though I've never been a huge fan of the Terminator franchise and am not entirely familiar with its lore, I ended up enjoying this anime. The story told here is pretty coherent and it makes sense even with limited knowledge. The essence of the terminator movies is captured surprisingly well, transmitting the feeling of a darkdystopian world where machines took over. This anime includes plenty of gore and blood, but it doesn’t feel out of place. It's believable that a killing machine would brutally tear through anything in its path.

The characters and plot are solid for what they are. Each character has their own flaws, and while eight episodes don’t provide much time for deep character development or extensive backstory, you still come to understand their motivations and actions. The plot also has a few twists and turns, some of which genuinely surprised me. The time travel elements are straightforward, with clear indications of the year in which the story is currently taking place, which helps prevent any confusion.

The soundtrack is somewhat underwhelming, as it doesn't really stand out. The animation is generally well done, though there are moments where heavy use of CGI is noticeable and doesn't look great. This is especially true in scenes where Malcolm is talking in a room with an AI named Kokoro. During wide shots, the CGI makes his model appear odd and lifeless.  The voice acting is excellent, featuring many recognizable names from popular mainstream anime.

I admittedly felt a bit skeptical about Terminator Zero but came out of the experience with a net positive feeling. It is not a masterpiece by any means or features the best writing but it can absolutely be enjoyed even as someone who has seen little or nothing about the Terminator franchise because it is written in such a way that you do not need it. For me, this was a solid anime to watch in between other shows. With only eight episodes, it’s a quick watch. It was enjoyable as it is, without needing to be anything more or overly complicating it."
59390,536374.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Great anime with intense action, addicting storytelling, and visually appealing animation. Terminator 0 is a really fun watch that's also quite easy to get into, as it's only 8 episodes long. This anime kind of reminds me of Pluto with how you cannot stop watching and feel a strong NEED to know what happens next, but Pluto is a near perfect anime, and so, it's hard to compete with that. Still, Terminator 0 does scratch a similar itch to what Pluto did. Every interaction with the Terminator was extremely intense, building perfect tension and suspense that leads you into being so unsure of how everything couldplay out. I've never seen the Terminator movies, but this anime convinces me I need to. 

You will not regret watching Terminator 0. It's fast and easy to watch, but you also gain so much satisfaction from the story and animation. You don't get a fully realized character development, but that's only because a season 2 is implied.

Great anime. Please watch."
59390,536632.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"This is unironically the best thing that happened to ""Terminator"" franchise since ""Terminator 2"". You don't have to watch ANY of the movies to understand this anime though, it is self explanatory and this is awesome. Magnificent soundtrack, great character development, solid plot. Some plot twists are predictable but it is not necessarily a bad thing: sometimes it just means that a title has its internal logic which is always great. Titular Terminator is very menacing, dangerous machine that can kill any character any given minute and this reminds me of Terminator 1 which was almost a horror movie. This is one of the best sci-fi anime series ofthe past few years and it deserves a watch."
59390,537254.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"As a longtime fan of the terminator series I would say this anime is the best thing to happen to the franchise after Terminator judgement day. Not exaggerating. The plot and story is very good. Most of the main characters and the terminator are likeable . They almost never make any dumb decisions. The music is the perfect blend of something new and a bit of judegment day's theme. The gore is alright but ive seen better, There's a handful of nostalgic callback scenes from the original first 2 movies . the terminator felt almost like arnold's terminator from the first movie, like anunstoppable killing machine that almost no one can help u escape , hes also very mysterious, reminds me of a homeless toji zenin . I love that this anime cleared up a lot about the effects of time traveling and changing the past and how it effects the future with the war and skynet . Although its only 8 episodes i appreciate that there's almost never a dull moment . Seeing a T-800 dual wielding M82 50.cal sniper rifles is prob the most badass thing ive seen in anything terminator related, like it honestly tops Arnold's shotgun on a motorcycle flip reload and minigun scene. 

I have a few complains
The CGI for the terminator's skeleton and the AIs holograms were a complete eye soar, they stood out pretty badly since everything else looks really good but ive seen way worse cgi to be fair . 
I hated the plot armor on a certain character is absolutely annoying, like she straights up fist fights and shoves T-800s around as if they dont weight a couple hundred kilos more than an adult human and as if they're not made of titanium . 
The kids were very annoying , they were straight up war of the world kids level of annoying . 
It felt as if the creator was a hardcore fanboy of spy family and just wanted a Yor forger in the series in the form of Misaki with how she fights and same voice actor."
59390,535700.0,6.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"🟡Summer 2024(I think) I admit that I have never watched the original Terminator trilogy with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the only movie from this universe that I watched as a kid was Terminator Salvationc (2009) and I remember it very well, that's why I couldn't miss the premiere of this anime and after watching the whole thing I say that it's really quite good, although after the first episodes I had mixed feelings...... This anime is an alternative version of the Terminator story from the perspective of Japan, MC who is a scientist, created his AI to stop Skynet from annihilating humanity, at the same time Eiko (resistance fighter)and Terminator (killing machine in the service of AI) come from the future, whose targets for various reasons are MC and his AI.

 Well...the plot starts slowly, at first it may seem too straightforward and sometimes a bit boring, the rather bloody action didn't help either, because it was filled with a lot of nonsense and was lazily written, which I will mention at the end.  But from a certain point the plot is much more intricate, surprising and focused, we get really few ""unnecessary scenes"" at the beginning everything seemed very predictable and it was, but towards the end we got some really interesting plot twists that made more or less sense, as for all this nonsense about time travel which I personally hate because in this type of plots there is always a lot of stupidity and paradoxes, but this anime seems to be aware of it and explains quite well how all this stuff about going back in time really works, that it is impossible to change the future, despite this the whole plot is based on the fact that Skynet sends the Terminator for this purpose, although it will not affect the time from which it was sent, additionally some facts that will be explained at the end make me feel that there is a lack of any consequence in all this.  Most of the time we observe two main plots, namely how the characters chase each other with the terminator (it is done in a more or less satisfying way) and how the MC lies/sits/stands and talks to his AI trying to convince it to help humanity and stop Skynet but the cold calculation of the AI that sees no reason for humans to survive, apart from their selfish survival instinct, is a tough opponent haha
We get a lot of interesting moral dilemmas, although all these moral and philosophical considerations are just long monologues from the characters who speak directly, the anime does not present it in a particularly interesting way, the AI will simply give you a whole argument about how ""humans are evil, they are a cancer to the Earth and must be eliminated"" blah blah.

Sometimes it seems that the series has too much pathos during the MC's conversations with the AI ​​and tries to be smarter than it really is, which can give way towards the end because I think that this plot ultimately turned out to be a bit too naive and too easily resolved, but still this whole plot is interesting, it can provoke thought and we get some pretty interesting concepts.

But getting back to the plot in general, almost all the plots develop nicely (although the Skynet plot seemed a bit ignored) and connect with each other, characters that at first glance might seem uninteresting get some nice development, characters have to make really difficult decisions, everyone has the right amount of time, mainly because we don't really have too many characters here.
Of course, not all of them are particularly interesting and the interesting ones aren't outstanding, but everyone gets ""something"", has their own task and doesn't seem like a complete filler.
 Mr. Terminator, who at first seems bland and makes no impression at all with his bulging eyes, becomes really cool and generally expressive throughout the anime, I like how often she changed clothes, once we had a slicked-down man in a suit and once we had some I don't know... shaman or something haha
Another plus is that the world reacts to everything that's happening and the police/military are interested, although it wasn't on such a scale (especially when it comes to the military) that I would have expected but still, the world is alive, but due to the limited budget, the cities seem deserted.

Unfortunately, we also get a few plot simplifications and quite a lot of stupidity, for example, the resistance movement, which in the post-apocalyptic future barely makes ends meet, is able to steal ultra-important data on time travel from Skynet, which was protected (from what we saw) by only one Terminator, additionally they are able to build a damn time machine... not very credible.
 Terminator slaughters randoms who have no self-preservation instinct and attack him, sacrificing their lives for our main characters (randoms from their perspective) and our heroes don't even mention it and the plot forgets about their ""glorious deeds"" XDD

Action scenes:
The accuracy of the character depends on the scenario, the character runs straight and the machine specialized in killing cannot hit him, really, I don't know who came up with this, how on earth these bullets don't hit.

We also have a lot of plot armor where the characters survive impossible situations, the antagonist, although previously presented as ruthless and finishing off his victims, suddenly after defeating the main character, they leave him just like that without killing him, just because the scenario tells them to.
 Eiko seems like a human terminator and her endurance and skills/strength are simply poorly written, which made it hard to feel respect for the Terminator at the beginning, because he gets his ass kicked by a ""regular woman"" yes, he keeps getting up and may seem like an unstoppable force but after the 10th time you manage to knock him down, it doesn't make such an impression anymore, at least that's how it was at the beginning, then it seems better, the action scenes also seem more logical in general, which means they are finally satisfying, brutality and a lot of blood definitely help with all of this.

Animation:
Mmm...it's not bad, although it's not good either, you could say it's average.

We get a lot of, often not very good CGI and a bit of recycled animation.

2D is pretty decent but could have been better, the animation is often quite wooden but of course we also get a few really good sequences so despite everything there's something to look forward to.
 We also have a censorship that I hate, where instead of setting the ""camera"" at such an angle that you can't see intimate places, you just draw boobs without nipples, it looks so weird that..yeah.
Overall, if I were to rate the animation itself, a 6/10 would be a reasonable rating.

The soundtrack also deserves special mention, as it was able to turn up the excitement of a given scene.


To sum up... it's simply worth watching, even though my review is quite critical.

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐❌❌❌❌"
59390,535955.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Terminator Zero is kinda infuriating but kino nonetheless The newest installation of the Terminator series brought us back right before the Judgement Day of 1997 from the eyes of Malcolm Lee, a scientist developing another artificial intelligence called Kokoro to rival skynet and stop the judgment day itself. Aside from Malcolm, we also seeing things from the perspective of Reiko and Misaki, both of which actually holds another key roles of the story. Characters in Terminator Zero are written quite nicely with some development and lots of mystery around them. The kids however written in such a way that will infuriate the audience and I guaranteeyour frustration watching two thirds of the series. But in the end of the day you'll understand that they're just kids and with what they've been through, man it's kinda hard not to sympathize with them in the end. Oh and they also got some nice development with one huge plot point being placed on one of the kid's shoulder. 

So, how's the plot written? Well since it's another Terminator entry, do expect a lot of cat and mouse game with A TON OF EXPOSITION AND TONS AND TONS OF TWIST IN THE END. The plot progress rather slowly but steadily aproaching a climax which in my case made me ponder for a while. The action and the chase scene iconic to the Terminator series is really delivered here with some call back to the original films. Not gonna lie, there's a few moment which I actually jumped a bit when the characters are being hunted by the terminator. 

As for the animation quality, Production I.G did pretty well animating the series. Never did I expect a Terminator anime but here we are. It's not Mappa or Wit kind of animation with their fast, fluid and smooth action scene nor the insanely detailed and painting-like quality of Kyoani or Comixwave but its still a decently animated anime. The fight scenes are a bit slow but heavy, the power which the Terminator holds are terrifyingly shown with a great amount of Gore. 
Sound design is meh, not really the best but not terrible. The guns sounds kinda weak and the music is forgettable. Oddly enough for me the best scenes in the series is actually when there's no music at all since it's focused on the dialogue which usually dropped a bomb. 

So yeah, that's my short review of the Terminator Zero. Tldr? 
It has a lot of flaws but it's definitely better than some of the latest Terminator movies. Ngl kinda want to kms watching the kids from ep 1-6 DEAR GOD THEY'RE THE WORST. But damn the last few episodes are just damnnn. 

I absolutely recommends you to watch it especially if you're a terminator fans or maybe a sucker for time travel shenanigans.

59390,535874.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Oh man, where do I even begin? If you're expecting a classic Terminator experience, you might be in the wrong place. This anime deviates significantly from the usual paths of the franchise and could even lead you to skip some scenes. The anime essentially consists of 50% philosophical dialogues and 50% Terminator-ish action. Rough Summary: Terminator Zero takes place parallel to the events of Terminator 3: Judgment Day, but in an alternate scenario in Japan. The plot follows Malcolm, a scientist who develops an AI to avert the threat of Skynet, and his three children. Central to the story are also Eiko, a resistance fighter fromthe future, a maid named Misaki who plays a significant role in the family, and a Terminator sent from the future to stop their mission. 

Philosophical depth and new approaches: The anime endeavors to add a deeper, philosophical level to the franchise. It deals with whether humanity deserves to be saved at all and what this means for the future. This line of thought is very reminiscent of works like Vivi, beatless and I, Robot. Rather than relying solely on raw action, Terminator Zero attempts to explore themes such as the value of human life and the logic of an AI.

The Terminator — Between threat and disappointment: The portrayal of the Terminator unfortunately fluctuates between terrifying menace and almost laughable helplessness. In some scenes he shows off his superhuman abilities, only to be effortlessly stopped by almost every character, even children, in other moments. This inconsistency robs it of much of the menace one would expect from a cold-blooded killing machine. Especially with a 17+ age rating, one might have expected harsher, more uncompromising action—perhaps something in the style of Mortal Kombat because of the weapon laws… Instead, the potential of this threat remains unfulfilled, and the often-absurd plot armor protects the characters from consequences that should seem unavoidable.

Visuals and soundtrack: On a positive note, Terminator Zero is visually quite impressive. The animations are solid, and the CGI is well integrated, even if it doesn't reach the level of a Cyberpunk: Edgerunner. There are some well-staged scenes that are pleasing to the eye, and the dark atmosphere is captured effectively. The soundtrack is solid overall, but the iconic Terminator theme is unfortunately only replaced by an uninspiring resample if I remember correctly, which detracts from the nostalgia factor.

Plot (Mild Spoilers) – Complex but Not Always Consistent: The plot develops into a complex web of intrigue and time travel throughout the series, leading to some surprising twists. This complexity is interesting on one hand, but it also results in inconsistencies, particularly in the logic of the time travel that is introduced.

Conclusion: Terminator Zero offers some fascinating new approaches and isn’t afraid to raise deeper philosophical questions. Visually, the anime is also convincing, and there are some exciting moments. However, despite these positive aspects, the series struggles with inconsistent character portrayals and a weak Terminator that loses much of its threatening presence. For fans who are open to new ideas and willing to engage with the philosophical discussions, Terminator Zero might still be worth a look. However, those expecting a return to the roots of the franchise might be disappointed.

59390,536086.0,9.0,False,False,,Recommended,"My opinion about the Terminator anime: I didn't have much faith in this ""Terminator anime"", but, look, Netflix has been surprising us with some very non-standard animes lately. The style of this anime and its theme gave me a Cyberpunk: Edgerunners vibe. I thought it was going to be another one of those generic ones, just more of the same, but I was wrong. The anime lives up to the franchise, with several references to the films and set in one of the countless timelines that the saga loves to explore. There are some twists that work well, some you expect, others take you bysurprise. 

The children, who I thought were going to be that annoying stereotype, actually have layers, development, and all the characters have their highlight moment in the plot. The action is good and it still has that horror atmosphere that was reminiscent of the first film. And the theme? Very current, talking about artificial intelligence. In the past, we only saw this in movies, and now we are here, surrounded by AI creating music, texts, images, videos…everything. 

The anime also brings some philosophies about life and machines, like several other futuristic films. But this has a difference: at a certain point, you are divided, sometimes on the side of the machines, sometimes on the side of the humans, until you reach the point where you no longer know who is right or wrong. The fine line between good and evil really begins to blur. But there are some moments that don't make sense (the films also suffer from this) that make us wonder: how can a machine miss so many shots and the police too? XD

Anyway, I thought this ""Terminator Zero"" was very good."
59390,537230.0,8.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"I enjoyed Terminator Zero despite not really being a big fan of the source material. I have seen the first two terminator movies and I thought they were pretty good. I just never felt the need to watch any of the others. I thought Terminator Zero did a pretty good job taking the story in a new direction without contradicting the source material. The show had a few twists I did not see coming, and I thought the action and suspense were pretty good. I really enjoyed seeing the surroundings through the Terminator's perspective (like you do in the original movies) in an anime. Thebiggest flaw with the anime itself is that, while not bad, the animation is not quite it. It can be a little bit off-putting at times, and feels a little subpar compared to what Production I.G. can do. Additionally, there is a big plot-hole in the story. Why did the computer scientist not simply bring his children to a saferoom inside the labs to begin with (or somewhere else with the same level of protection), if he suspected that technology was going to rise against humans."
59390,536455.0,7.0,False,False,,Mixed Feelings,"The tricky thing about developing new entries in the Terminator franchise is that they have to contain some pretty specific plot and character elements in order to be recognisable as Terminator stories. Omit the titular robot assassins or drastically alter their purpose and it wouldn't be a Terminator story. But equally, stick too closely to the established elements and you end up with something that feels derivative and pointless. It's a fine line to ride, and Terminator Zero attempts it with varying levels of success. Your cyborg assassin for the evening is an off-the-peg T800, the premium vanilla of murderbots. The story doesn't attempt any newgimmicks with the terminator itself, but it gives a solid showing for the old classic. Meanwhile, a grizzled future soldier is sent back in time to stop it. So far, so ""I &lt;3 1984."" Fortunately they're not attempting to kill/save a future military leader, so it diverges from formula there, if only a little. The thing that turns Malcolm into an assassination target isn't entirely untrodden ground for the franchise, but at least isn't something that has been done to death in the movies, so it feels relatively fresh.

Coming from Production IG, it's a lavish-looking show with lots of intense and well-animated action. The nature of the action scenes often isn't particularly imaginative though, in one instance being an almost verbatim rehash of a scene from the original movie. On the other hand, I have no complaints about the eerily understated music, which adds a lot to the tension and atmosphere.

On most fronts, Terminator Zero varies from competent to solid. The main place where it falls short is the characters. They're a generally unlikeable bunch, especially early on, which makes it difficult to care about their fate in the first half of the show. Some of them undergo some oddly abrupt personality shifts too. Malcolm's youngest child suddenly changes from selfish, naive brat to mature and contemplative after her first encounter with the terminator. Meanwhile, future soldier Eiko goes from driven to wishy-washy around the same time, and winds up getting so sidetracked that she almost falls out of the story until the climax.

The other thing playing against the characters is the dubtitles, which have the most overt case of fifteening I've seen since Manga Video's 90s heyday. It flat-out changes the personality of some characters, especially Misaki who sounds polite and demure in the Japanese dialogue, but drops F-bombs in the subtitles.

Complaints aside, the show does get stronger and more distinctive as it goes along. Some of the twists are predictable, but they do serve to make the story more interesting. Overall I'd rank it somewhere in the middle of the franchise: above the messy T3 and the derivative Dark Fate, but significantly below the first two movies and The Sarah Connor Chronicles."
57325,537715.0,8.0,False,False,,Recommended,"If you love cats or gourmet anime, or both cats AND Food, look no further than Ramen Akaneko, an anime I feel was specifically made to appeal to people like me who love cats and food! Our protagonist Tamako is recommended to apply for work at Ramen Akaneko, a Ramen joint run by cats. Cats that can talk. And cook. And serve customers. Like some kind of fever dream come true. Her job - to take care of the cats, by brushing them (!!!) And they decide to hire her because she isn't a cat lover who will be unprofessional and fawn on them (!!!) Soonshe gets to know all the cats, and like any cat lover will tell you, they all have different personalities. Seriously though the characters (cats specifically) are the best thing about this anime. Apologies in advance but I'm going to describe them using terms familiar to the cat lover types.
* Bunzou - the orange ""ginger"" kitty, instead of being the feisty one orange brain cell, is the semi gruff, professional chef
* Sabu - the black ""void"" Kitty is the sous chef, with a hobby most will be surprised to learn about
* Hana - the white ""cloud?"" kitty is so dang adorable she's in charge of customer service
* Sasaki - the bicolor silver and white tabby is the moneybags Boss of the operation, and
* Krishna - the ""muscle"" tiger is the shy, sweet, ramen maker!

Watching each character's story get revealed while they live their daily life is mostly comforting. This is a slice of life, that happens to have a found family of felines plus one human worker who regains her confidence after working for a different kind of business, one that is kinder to their employees than her previous place of work. 

Initially I thought this had an Iyashikei slice of life with lots of comedy BUT some of the stories are a bit too hard hitting for that, involving bullying, workplace drama, internet fame, consent, legal issues and death. This anime just happens to use the vehicle of cute cats to try and take some of the sting out of what would otherwise be seriously traumatic issues. After the credits there are short vignettes of behind the scenes type footage, most are comedic in nature.

The biggest downside of this anime is the animation is inconsistency between the 3D and 2D styles. The main cats look great, but sometimes the tiger's anatomy seems a bit wonky, the humans too. Thankfully all the food looks good so there's that check mark for the gourmet watcher in me, but ... the food doesn't look mouthwatering delicious like some of the better gourmet anime I've watched.

Overall, this would be a good show to introduce the older, younger or food or cat lovers to anime since it's PG with none of the fan service cringe stuff that will turn some viewers off. Personally I enjoyed watching this every week, with one of my cats on my lap getting treats while I went Aww and pet the kitty, all the while WISHING a place like this existed because as a former Persian caretaker I am eminently qualified and I want that job!"
57325,537634.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Red Cat Ramen - Cats running a restaurant? Interesting. It's insane to know that there are all kinds of works featuring anthropomorphic animals, but when it comes to actual anime representation, they're far and few in-between. But let's cut to the chase, from  the absurdly weird Egumi Legacy to the fantasy-laden Bye Bye, Earth, only one show in this Summer 2024 season, will I tempt to request you to take a second chance to watch: mangaka Angyaman's Ramen Akaneko a.k.a Red Cat Ramen, which has an interesting tale of how it got from the books to the small screen. Created by mangaka Angyaman, his first foray beingthe short-lived 2-volume series Yoru wo Higashi ni a.k.a East, Into The Night, as a Shueisha Shonen Jump+ title, it was intriguing, but nothing much more from that. Then came the breakthrough that would be Ramen Akaneko, which got its start on Jump Rookie, attracting a fanfare attention of a record 400k views within 3 days, enough for the manga to be serialized as an indie series, and then promoted to regular serialization, all within the space of less than a year from November 2021 to October 2022. And mind you, this side project for Indie series in Jump+ was brand new at the time of its inception in April 2021, and this manga alongside mangaka You Chiba's Yochien Wars a.k.a Kindergarten Wars, are the only 2 series that achieved this unpredecented record. This leaves the manga (as of this review) at 9 volumes and counting, which is a testament that Shonen Jump+ titles like mangaka Masaoki Shindo's massively popular RuriDragon have a spot at achieving big things whilst getting attention like the heavy hitters out there. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

If you have to define a slice-of-life series, Ramen Akaneko would be it, and it embraces the genre to its full potential. The titular establishment of a ramen shop that's run by talking cats, it has always been the bread and butter of operations, until a human comes around seeking a job at said restaurant. This human would turn out to be a young woman by the name of Tamako Yashiro, who quit her job at an advertising design company, citing its toxic environment. The admission of Tamako being that she's more of a dog person than a cat person, she soon takes responsbility of upholding the restaurant's unique morales and values, led by the orange tabby cat of head chef Bunzo and the grey tuxedo cat of restaurant owner Pudding Sasaki. Alongside its other unique characters, the black cat of sous-chef Sabu, the white cat of customer service manager Hana, as well as the Siberian/Bengal-offspring tiger of in-house noodle maker Krishna, a day in Ramen Akaneko always has unexpected surprises in store for Tamako and the cats.

Despite being a series full of episodic vignettes, the strength of Ramen Akaneko lies in its characters, who're all quite the unique animals they are, as much as Tamako is relegated to kitten-brushing duty for the cats who're constantly shedding their fur, and that would not be good if it got in the way of the delicious and sumptuous ramen that the restaurant makes and serves to its loyal  customers who come back time and time again for some unique ramen served by animals instead of humans. Take Krishna for example: despite being voiced by (surprise, surprise) Saori Hayami of Spy x Family's Yor Forger fame, the tiger, despite her big size, sharply contrasts her shy and kindhearted nature so much so that she's always at the back of house making ramen noodles, never to be seen at the restaurant only until everyone is gone, or if she needs to be involved to resolve conflicts. Most certainly, a day in Ramen Akaneko will bring comfort and wholesomeness, no matter what will happen.

The animation is serviceable enough but is notable since this is legendary director Park Sunghoo and his new studio of E&amp;H Production at the helm. Even though the Korean director has received an amount of flack given the atrocity that was Winter's Ninja Kamui, this show may not showcase great production values, but it's not the aspect of what you came here for in the first place. The unusual art style actually compliments the show enough to make it look like a 2.5D anime, and I have to say that it works to good effect.

The music is rather fine, though Wednesday Campanella did put out a decent OP, as well as Rikon Densetsu with its ED. The OST is rather lacking, and considerably little more effort to this would've helped elevate the show even by a shot. Not the best, however.

In the end, what you came for for Ramen Akaneko a.k.a Red Cat Ramen, is its comforting atmosphere and subtlety that less is more, simplicity beats complexity, and happiness is all you need to rest for a show that can make you feel like a couch potato to sit, watch, and just relax in all of its goodness.

It's an easy show to pass up, but please don't skip because of its ugliness and unrefined animation, but come to a warm-hearted, fuzzy feeling that you're home, just sipping on some ramen and having a solitude with anthropomorphic cats. And within the cusp of the progressive life, slowing down will help you regain your senses to savour a hearty meal, which sometimes, is all you need."
57325,537708.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"I came in with low expectations, as I remember watching a trailer and thinking it looked ""mid"" but I really did enjoy this series! It is a cozy SOL. All the cats feel very unique in each of their personalities. The episodic format works well, giving time for each character to be fleshed out. Each episode or vignette is enjoyable. After the credits, the ""Daily Akenko"" is a neat addition that gives us more insight into the vignettes. What I wasn't a fan of was two main things. The animation leaves much to be desired and the MC was very bland. Despite that, it isa solid feels-good SOL about Cats &amp; Ramen what's not to love?"
57325,537695.0,6.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Do not be fooled! Despite the cover art and its low popularity, this is not a kid's show; this is a legitimate, cozy SoL and a must-try for cat-lovers. The Good: • Charming Main Cast — All of the cats have distinct and enjoyable personalities. Really good job of anthropormorphization. • Voice Acting — The VA isn't exaggerated and feels pretty natural. I was shocked at how this show managed to snag some very popular actors. The Not Good: • Animation — The biggest issue by far, and why I dinged the score hard. For a primarily CG anime, the art *style* is pretty convincing during low action scenes, butthe animation is just straight up bad when there's a lot of movement, especially with humans. Background characters and even the main character walking around can look cursed.
• Bland MC — The show focuses on the ramen shop as a whole rather than primarily just the MC, and she seemed a little bit of a self-insert. Perhaps they will dive into her more in a later season. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Despite my critical score, I really enjoyed this one. It was one of the few shows I looked forward to during its season."
56189,538640.0,3.0,False,False,,Not Recommended,"Grendizer U is the first TV anime based on the Mazinger franchise in 15 years, the first anime adaptation of the UFO Robo Grendizer series in nearly 50 years, and a collaboration between staff members that worked on mecha classics like Gundam SEED, Code Geass and Evangelion… and it’s not good. I really wanted to like this show, and there’s a lot of ideas here that could lead to an interesting story, but the series just ultimately was a massive let down. I’ll address the elephant in the room about this show upfront: the pacing sucks. Grendizer U feels like it’s trying to have a whole50 episodes worth of plot despite only having 13 episodes to work with, so everything feels incredibly rushed, from the fights almost all ending in 2 attacks, to the characters suddenly going from not standing each other to developing strong bonds in the span of 1 episode, to the loads of exposition to advance the multiple plotlines being juggled every episode, and this just makes everything about it feel lacking in impact. I mean, I know the state of the modern anime industry sucks so asking for 2 cours was probably too much, but then they could just write the plot to actually fit the 1 cour they have, it’s not like good mecha anime that are only 1 cour don’t exist, Shin Jeeg told a coherent plot in the same time and had cool stuff like the double Jeeg battle. The show has multiple plots that are brought up, never elaborated on, and then dropped that coupled with the ending make it feel like the staff desperately want to get a second season, but given how that went for the last Mazinger anime, I won’t hold my breath for one.

Speaking of cool battles, that’s the other key issue with his show: it’s just boring. I wasn’t expecting a masterpiece of story given how messy the plots of SEED and Geass are, but I was looking forward to a fun super robot in the spirit of previous Mazinger anime like Shin and Mazinkaiser, but this show is incredibly dull. Aside from the OP and ED none of the music here is memorable, I wouldn’t care for any of these characters if I wasn’t familiar with their past versions as their relationships (with the exception Koji with Duke, for the better, and Teronna with Duke, for the worse) have no time to develop, and with the battles being so short, I hardly found myself interested in seeing how they were going to play out, which is a shame because I think the CGI mecha in the show are on the better side and the moments where they change to 2D actually feel they could be cool with the proper context. I mean, the animation of the show in general isn’t stellar, in fact I’d even call it subpar, and some of the character designs were redesigned better than others (I still don’t get why Sayaka has purple hair?), but I wasn’t expecting it to seeing as Gaina is basically Gainax’s corpse somehow still moving even after Anno took away their sustain.

This isn’t a slap in the face of the original like Devilman Crybaby was, but as far as Go Nagai remakes go, Grendizer U is sadly one of the weaker entries and I wouldn’t recommend it as an entry point for people not familiar with the Mazinger franchise. Go and do yourself a favor and watch Shin Mazinger Shougeki! Z-hen if you want to see a modern remake of this classic mecha franchise done right.

Thank you for reading"
56189,538600.0,6.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Guess I'm finally actually using this like my Letterboxd and Backloggd since I'm not waiting for anime to get added to the former. Anyways, show is loads of fun, but it really suffers from the unfortunate issue of being a mecha anime made when it's impossible to get even slice of life shit to hit 24 episodes. Grendizer U's biggest issues (besides some really wonky 2D art outside of battle scenes or still shots of the mechs) however is that its pacing is all over the pace. Characters and events seem to just happen and occur like they're teleporting around settings and locations. Again, alot of this feels like it can be squarely blamed on episode count as Mitsuo Fukuda whose work I've become more familiar with after watching Gundam Seed earlier in the year across none of that series has characters just teleport around locations. Also as someone who hasn't watched or read OG Grendizer yet I do know some things about it and yeah this is just a speedran remake of the original story and what I'm truly excited for is the potential of the next season pulling an Evangelion 3.0 and being something with much more leeway to go batshit crazy and be wholly different.

Gotta reiterate that it's a genuinely fun as hell show, but definitely not something I'd go to someone and say HOLY HELL DAWG YOU GOTTA WATCH THIS SHIT!! Like I would with Shin Mazinger Z or Getter Robo Armageddon which are other anime of the big mecha grandfathers meant to be original and psychotic retellings or reinterpretations of the classics. That being said Grendizer U very similar to this years earlier release Bravern while not being perfect or this case particularly great still has highs that surpass almost everything else airing the same season despite their lows. Both series are a loud and defiant cry towards the current industry issues that despite it all Mecha will never die.

Now which country likes Getter Robo the most? We can get them to get us something like this for Getter by using the entire countries tax dollars."

The characters are clearly less interesting and less well-written in this version (and it's not the surface depth they vainly try to create that's going to save it), some characters are clearly useless, the love plots that are brought to the fore are clearly not very thrilling, the subtlety of the story is non-existent and the episodes are frankly uneven (a problem ofthe original, by the way).

What's left to salvage in this season is a real willingness to reappropriate Goldorak, which I find quite courageous given the myth that it is once again, and here they went all out! Even though the ideas clearly didn't appeal to me, and I find them really poorly exploited, you can't take away from their desire to truly remake the anime and not just copy and paste a more contemporary version, as with many remakes, and that's great.

In the end, I was really disappointed by this season, which is shaky in a number of respects, but this desire to create something new makes me hope for a sequel that will be much more successful and where the staff will be able to exploit its ideas more effectively (and honor the characters, because things aren't going well at the moment, give us back our Maria).

In short, I'm not crazy, but I'm hopeful for a better future (by the way, the ending is brilliant)."

I never expected the fights to be this entertaining with so many different, creative movesets. Things are very simple to understand even for a new fan as there is a lot of expositon and discussions about past events. The characters, although pretty flat, have a lot of charm to them. There is a distinct personality to all of them. The thing I feel like this series does the best is having extremely unique as well as imaginative character designs. You can see how a certaincharacter will act and fight as soon as you first lay your eyes on them. 

Not to go into too much detail, I would just like to summarise ""Kinnikuman: Perfect Origin Arc"" as simple, yet entertaining."
54730,538320.0,7.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Kinnikuman: Perfect Origin Arc is a very weird anime that is also quite rewarding. This is obviously a fighting anime that takes every aspect of that type of anime and turns it up to an 11. This is a silly arc from a silly series, and I suppose I better start watching more of this anime in the future. Obviously, this entire thing is fighting scenes, but if you're even a minor WWE fan like I am, you will enjoy the ridiculousness of this anime. One moment, a giant baby is having a tantrum, the next, someone is getting skin boiled off. It's a wilddichotomy, but it really works. It might not make for the best anime of the year, but it certainly makes for an entertaining watch. 

The animation style is pretty standard but isn't ugly to look at. The pacing isn't bad, although it can feel awkward given that we (I) don't know what happens before or after this arc, so it feels like just a slice of a larger story. It obviously is, so I'm not counting it against the anime, I'm just saying this will obviously affect my viewing of this season as its own standalone thing, but hey... at least it makes me curious enough to dig into this series."
59497,533850.0,10.0,False,False,,Recommended,"The second season of Rising Impact builds on the foundation laid in the first season. It dives deeper into the world of competitive golf while further developing its young protagonist, Gawain Nanaumi. This season continues to blend the intensity of sports anime with the technical intricacies of golf, making it both educational and entertaining. Story and Character Development Season 2 focuses on Gawain's growth as a golfer and competitor facing increasingly challenging opponents at the prestigious Camelot Academy. The narrative explores the psychological and emotional hurdles of pursuing greatness in an often organized and slow-paced sport. Gawain's journey becomes more complex as he faces skilled rivals whobring their unique strategies and backstories into play.

One of the standout aspects of this season is how it handles character interactions and rivalries. Gawain’s relationships with his peers, particularly Lancelot Norman and Kiria Nishino, are explored more deeply, adding layers to their characters and making their conflicts on the golf course more compelling. However, while these relationships are fleshed out, some secondary characters still feel underdeveloped, which might leave viewers wanting more from these interactions.

Animation and Direction
The animation quality remains consistent with the first season, with Lay-duce doing a commendable job bringing the sport to life. The depiction of golf techniques, weather conditions, and terrain intricacies is visually engaging, making each match feel unique and thrilling. Director Hitoshi Nanba continues to use the same methods that kept the first season visually dynamic, ensuring that even non-golf enthusiasts can stay engaged with the story.

Themes and Execution
A recurring theme in this season is perseverance in the face of adversity. Gawain’s journey highlights the mental toughness required to succeed in a sport as demanding as golf. This season also delves into the importance of strategy over raw power, as Gawain learns that every shot requires careful consideration of multiple factors. This lesson is well illustrated through the various challenges he faces.

However, some of the first season's criticisms persist. The pacing occasionally feels uneven, with specific episodes dragging due to the detailed focus on golf mechanics, which might appeal to only some viewers. Additionally, while the season provides some resolution to ongoing storylines, it still needs a clear long-term objective, leaving the overall narrative direction somewhat ambiguous.

Final Thoughts
Rising Impact Season 2 is a solid continuation of the series, offering a deeper look into the sport of golf through the lens of shonen anime. It balances technical detail with character drama, though it might only partially satisfy viewers looking for more traditional sports anime pacing. For fans of the first season and those interested in golf, this season provides a rewarding experience despite minor shortcomings.

Overall, Rising Impact Season 2 is worth watching for its unique blend of sports action and detailed exploration of golf, earning it a strong recommendation for fans of the genre."

Basically my enjoyment boils down to how much I can suspend my disbelief. I haven't really watch sports anime before, so I don't know how they normally go, but I wasn't expected it to go full dragon ball z with the power creep. As someone who played junior golf myself, I guess it is easy for me to see the lack of realism in it all. Basically every aspect of golf is turned up to 11, and beyond. The show hasgood characters and overall story, but it is just constantly unrealistic in pretty much every aspect that it is hard for me to just watch the show without the situation at just about every level feeling wrong. I do freaking love Gawain and Lancelot though, the characters also have turned up personalities that makes them very interesting and endearing. 

So the golf holes themselves are completely unrealistic, players have unrealistic skills(before we even get to the people with actual super powers), and players are way too easily affected by the games of others, good players fall apart too easily, and get back into form just as easily as well. Also the courses are so long, have so much elevation change, you'd have to have legs like a mountain climber to make it through 18 holes. The pacing of matches and general formats also just don't make sense. Like every group stopped playing after 9 holes and waited for the half way scores to be tallied, this would never happen and would make a very long course that already takes all day to play even longer, especially with the amount of other drama and slowdowns happening on the course, it would be like a 12+ hour round of golf for all of this stuff to happen. Also, any of the star players are already good enough to go pro - if you are shooting eagles and albatrosses on ridiculously hard fantasy holes, you could tear apart any hole on the actual pro tour- why is there a guy who has won a tournament 4 years in a row still wasting his time as an amateur? Just go pro and you'd literally already be at the top.

I get that it is fantasy, and I am supposed to go with it, but I feel like they go too far too often where it just feels disconnected from reality I am not even sure what kind of universe the show is taking place in.

So yeah, I enjoy the show, and the character development actually is pretty good and got me liking characters I didn't think I would. It's just that the show is so far from reality in actual golf that it really takes away in some aspects. I wish they could have ramped up player abilities more slowly, contained the power creep and milked it for more, because after the first season things only got more out of hand and it seems like there is really no where to go after this season. If you don't care about any kind of realism and can just turn your brain off to follow the story and characters, then it's probably great though, I just have trouble doing that."

52085,536573.0,6.0,False,False,,Recommended,"Naoko Yamada's ability to purely express emotions through her marriage of audio and visuals is undeniably strong at this point. She seems to understand exactly what type of scene, what movements, and which colors totally encapsulate what she's trying to convey. Garden of Remembrance is a short that completely leans into this style of storytelling. It depicts a girl through her day to day life as we learn that she is grieving the loss of her lover, but there is essentially no dialogue and the whole short is set to music (by Lovely Summer Chan). Despite having some reservations, I definitely enjoyed this and foundthat especially by the end, I appreciated what it was going for quite a bit.

Right from the gate, this short sets itself up to be largely presented through it's imagery, much of which the viewer has to read into themselves. We're immediately met with the image of anemone flowers, which are often symbolic of the loss of a loved one. Yamada often includes the language of flowers in her works but here it's basically a core part of the story. Shots of water are intercut with what seems like a cup of coffee and then a gust of wind (and what I assumed to be the lover's ghost) sweeps from above and into the girl's room through her window. We get a shot from a bird's eye view watching over her.

We watch as the girl goes through the motions of her day to day routine. All of Yamada's characteristic attention to small details are present here. The animation feels alive and believable. We watch her struggle to wake up, brush her teeth and eat breakfast each day. She drinks and plays the guitar and occasionally a few emojis appear on screen. I admittedly found this part to overstay it's welcome a bit. The music is building up and it had me expecting something to happen that would warrant this implied tone, but that doesn't come until much later in the film. With the full context, I can better appreciate what it was going for, but I do feel this first bit could have had a bit more going on.

After noticing a girl with glasses buy anemone flowers the girl goes and buys some as well. As she's painting, she hears a noise in her closet. When she opens it, a flood of memories erupts from inside and sweeps her off her feet. I really liked the visual of these emotions being trapped in her closet as though she had been trying to bottle them up and is now overwhelmed by her memories and feelings. We see shots of her and her lover recontextualizing all of her seemingly mundane acts as things she used to share together with him. They wake up, brush their teeth and eat together. She had been playing his guitar, and so on. She walks across anemone pedals to embrace him. The visuals and music are really evocative and all of the messaging is finally on full display in this sequence. After reconciling with her emotions, the girl mouths along to lyrics of acceptance and saying goodbye to her lover. Finally, we're shown a shot of her entering her apartment accompanied by someone else, likely implying that she has been able to start properly moving on. This whole climactic bit did a great job selling what the short had been going for and left me with a positive impression overall. 

There are aspects that weren't so easy for me to get behind. Rather than focusing entirely on her routine, I would've liked to see some indication of the lover character in the first bit, even if not in a way that gives away that he's passed on. I honestly was a bit confused when shots of him started appearing only after halfway through the short and only gathered it was her lover during the flashback sequence. The use of emojis was apparently meant to be the boyfriend's attempts to communicate with the girl but I never felt it was clearly conveyed and was mistaking it for being just an on-the-nose visual of what the girl was thinking and feeling. It wasn't till I read the MAL synopsis, that literally spells out ""The emoticon is ME watching over YOU"". Similarly, the girl with the glasses is meant to be a childhood friend, which again I only understood after reading the MAL synopsis. There were shots that were, I guess, meant to convey the characters' relationship to each other, but I didn't find that they clearly communicated it, personally. I think that if the film had a few more elements that were tangible and less purely depicted with interpretable imagery, it would've helped to smooth over these bumps that had me a bit confused.

Overall this was a really strong showing of what I believe Naoko Yamada is one of the industry's bests at: pure emotional expression through evocative audio visual presentation. It may not quite hold up to the level of polish that her longer works have, but shares many of the same strengths you would find in those. Definitely worth checking out.

The ones with jump scares don't really work, the series could do with fewer of those. However, since this is season 13, it seems like resorting to some cheap tricks is expected. Overall, this is a solid six. It's not awful, it's not great, it's just alright. As usual episode 13 ties things together just a little more, and as the norm, each episode is a standalone story outside of that. Some of the art direction this season is a bit odd, a bit too muchlike scribbles.

Season 2 though? It's kind of a disappointing follow up to be honest. Apart from arguably being even more educational about history, this season really wasn't as interesting or exciting to watch due to it pretty much lacking what made season 1 good in the first place. Unlike the first season, the stakes of the missions here were almost non-existent in comparison and also didn't haveany of the harder hitting moments like the best episodes of season 1 did (with the exception somewhat being the story of the rogue agent in episode 6). Even bringing up the more fun than serious aspects, season 2 doesn't really deliver on that front either as the more laidback episodes of the previous season had a much better sense of creativity and fun than this one did.

The final episode wasn't bad although unfortunately a bit predictable in the end and the ending was fine but pretty average as well. The best compliment that can probably be given to this season is Yumiko. She was pretty likable and being more similar in personality to Bon made their dynamic together more fun to watch than Ream with Bon. However, by the end she ultimately wasn't as well written or memorable as a character as Ream and also obviously didn't have nearly as large an effect on Bon as a character.

I don't outright not recommend watching this season as some will likely still enjoy it just as much as the last one, but if I were to have any possible rewatches in future it'll personally definitely be for just the first season only."

The original series isn't even available to legally stream anywhere, and the last part of the anime never even got an official sub, meaning that most people watching this show will not have watched the original and have no legal way to do so even if they're interested. So the circumstances for a full remake seemed perfect. Instead we spend a whole episode explaining all of the stuff we're not going to see (a lot of which looks really cooland interesting), before jumping neck deep into a story with characters we barely know. Sure, it's a very long story and the likelihood it would have gotten all the way to this arc was low, but dropping viewers this deep into the story with only a recap episode as context is a much, much worse solution.

The episode itself was just a recap. Which is generally not very compelling anime. And it holds true here as well. It's made a little bit better by virtue that this is all new to viewers like myself, but the breakneck pace makes it hard to appreciate any of the story, characters, or action.

This is all accompanied by stellar animation and cinematography. The downside is that this show is on the shorter side, so the story can feel a bit simplistic and we only see the development of a few characters. Also, there’s some additional characters hinted throughout who we don’t actually get to meet,which is a bummer since they look pretty cool. Overall, this is a good show to check out."

Beautiful animation, hundreds of references, crossovers that we've never seen and dozens of wallpaper-worthy shots. Seeing 3D characters in 2D animation for the first time is a treat. Bump of Chicken was a weird choice but it really fits the nostalgic vibe it has going for. I also have to comment there's some weird missing characters (Soundwave, Shockwave, Chromedome...) given how many robots appear, but it's clear the theme of the PV is centered more about the main protagonists. I love Transformers, I love Trigger, and if you still don't think there's any value inthe Transformers franchise after seeing this, nothing more can be done for you. Please Takara and Hasbro, let Trigger make the full show they obviously want."

They seem to be into Kouji Morimoto in particular: Aesthetically, this is primarily a big hommage to the opening sequence of Dirty Pair: The Movie (aka Project Eden), ""Safari Eyes"", with some other references (Dirty Pair TV ending, Space Adventure Cobra ending, ...) thrown in for good measure - basically the best of 80s psychedelic cheese. It's all directed byMasanobu Hiraoka (mostly known as a pinch hitter for premium anime endings, as seen in LWA TV, Made in Abyss S2 and Dororo among others), and he brings his distinct abstract and fluid transition style to the table here, which is a great fit for the basic look.

And that's pretty much all you get here, Justice got their label to pay the Chainsaw Man ED 9 guy to remake Safari Eyes, and it works very well. I also happen to like the song a lot, so that's a winner. Definitely worth 3 minutes of your time if you're into 80s aesthetics and/or purely technical merits of animation."
